_jo1UnkkD-A,The Best Game Controller,"- Hey, guys, this is Austin. So there are a ton of different controllers to choose from, but which one's the best? To find out, I gathered a few of the best ones around and to start with we have the PlayStation 4 DualShock 4. This is a big improvement over the last generation. However, there're couple other options that you might wanna look at, including the Xbox One Elite. Now, this is a controller that honestly, I think is probably one of the best that I've ever tried. You have customizable things like the D-pad. You can adjust how the sticks are. There's a lot that you can do, even with paddles on the back, however, we can even take it a step farther. If you really want to get on that customization game, Xbox has a Design Lab option, so essentially, what this allows you to do is take a standard Xbox One controller, which is already good and pretty much customize it however you want and by customize it however you want, I mean give it a different paint job. You actually can't get all the extra buttons and stuff from the Elite, I mean, unless you get one of these, but that's for later. You design it, we build it. Well, let's see what I actually designed. Oh, right, it's orange. So this is the masterpiece of a controller that we made. It's got that whole Creamsicle vibe with the orange, got the orange grips and the white everywhere, but you have a little bit of gray on the thumbsticks as well as the buttons and if you wanna take it one step farther, you can add a message to the controller, so I added my gamertag, also my Twitter and my Facebook and my Instagram, definitely make sure to check me out, links in the description, but on top of that, you can also get it on your controller and of course, this is a standard Xbox One controller. It comes with AA batteries because, I don't know, Microsoft hates rechargeables, I have no idea. If you really want to take things to the next level, you can get a Scuf controller. Now, this is the version for the Xbox, however, there also is a PS4 version. Did you order this controller? I don't know if I actually know what this controller looks like, so this is a Ken special right here. I picked out the awesome Creamsicle look of this one. This Scuf controller, I have no idea what it looks like. Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no. (laughs) Ken, what is this, what is this!? Ken, what were you? Okay, so if you (laughs) want the ugliest Scuf controller of all time. God, that is, yeah, okay, so if you want a Scuf controller that looks like this, your boy Ken'll hook you up, I guess. Did you see that Scuf controller? It's red and black, why didn't you get one of these? (stammers) You know what this feels like. This feels like when you go into Subway and they're like, ""Okay, what options would you like?"" and you have that moment of panic of like, ""I want anchovies and spinach and bologna and the sweet bread."" and then you get this and then you wonder where you went wrong in life. (laughs) I actually do like the texture on the back of this thing. You know what, it feels almost like a truck bed liner if you've ever felt one of those kind of rubbery things. That is definitely not going anywhere. Something else you get with Scuf are paddles, so this is one of the things that you can customize before you order the controller, so we went all out and got all four, but these are mappable to, say, like your face buttons or basically, whatever you want, I believe. I mean, to be fair, this is like by far, the most expensive controller here, so I would expect it to be cool, but this is alright. What's cool is all of these controllers will not only work on the console, but also for PC, so on the Xbox One side of things, they all work out of the box if you plug them in via USB and the newer ones such as the Xbox One Design Lab controllers have Bluetooth built in. If you don't wanna use Bluetooth, you can also pick up the adapter, so this is just a little USB wireless adapter for the Xbox One, so even with some of the older controllers that don't have Bluetooth, plug this into your computer and you're good to go. The same thing applies for the PS4, so if you pick up the DualShock 4 adapter for PC, it actually works for a Mac too if you wanna do that for some reason, then you just pick up this guy, plug it in, and you're up and running with the DualShock 4. Now, that's actually one of the advantages of the DualShock 4 is that it's cheap, so right now, it's around $45 or so, but you usually can find them for around 50 and that's cheaper than pretty much anything else here. Now, of course, you can get a standard Xbox One controller for about that price, but as soon as you get into the custom options, it gets pricey. So the Design Lab controller is $80. Now, that does give you full customization of all the colors and buttons and everything and for $90, you can get your name engraved on it, so it's not that much of a price premium, however, when you get up to the Elite, it gets pricey. This guy is $150. (cash register ching) Mind you it does come with this carrying case, which not only is a nice place to store your controller, but you also get a ton of different options for it, so for example, you can add your paddles, which just pop right on here and what's cool is all these are completely magnetic, so if we want we can get all of our paddles and with the Xbox One Elite, you actually have a button right up top here, so you can slide between two different profiles, so that's easy and on the Xbox, you can actually select tons of different profiles and have them saved, so for example, you can have a custom controller set up for, say, Forza, maybe one for Call of Duty, one for Battlefield, whatever you want. The idea that everything on the Elite controller is based on magnets is really cool too, so if you want say a domed thumbstick, you can easily swap that on or if you want something a little bit taller, it just pops right on, you're good to go and like I said earlier, the Scuf is definitely going to cost you, so if you just want more of an aesthetic build, kind of like the Design Lab, you're talking about and around the $120 range, however, if you really want all the bells and whistles with the custom grips and the paddles and all that kind of stuff, this thing is gonna cost you. The big question though, is with all these controllers here, sure, it's nice to see which one looks the coolest, but which one is actually the best one for gaming. (vocalizing) Ken, you're gonna kind of like make it appear right there, right? Yeah, it just appears right there, so is this gonna like you ignore all of my mouth noises, like add actually like a cool sound effect and then like as I wave my hands, like I'm gonna need like a puff of smoke and then the computer appears, got that. So to start with, we have the Design Lab controller. Now, even though on the outside, this is a custom controller, on the inside, it's pretty much exactly the same as any other Xbox controller and because of that, it's solid, so while sure, it doesn't have some of the cool paddles of the Elite, oh, I got it, I got it, what's cool about the Design Lab controllers is that since they're all based on the updated Xbox One controller with Bluetooth and the headphone jack, it means that while you can still use this with a PC and the standard wireless adapter, but if you're computer has Bluetooth, you just pair it right up and it's gonna work right out of the box. Next, we have the Elite controller. So there're actually a couple of advantages to this and one of the more subtle things is just the feel of the controller, so it's a little bit heavier and I really like the slightly kind of, I'll say grippy sort of texture, but it's like a very soft rubber. It doesn't sound like it would be good on a controller, but it actually feels nice. Next, we have the Scuf controller. So this one's a little bit more of a mixed bag. On one hand, it feels solid, so I like the grip and the way that the thumbsticks are weighed, it actually is really nice, however, the thing is you're paying a lot for this and honestly, it doesn't really feel that much different than another Xbox controller. The thing is I prefer the way the Elite controller does customization, so say I'm playing Horizon 3 right now and I only want two paddles, well, it's easy as just taking them off or say swapping thumbsticks out, whereas with the Scuf, what you order is pretty much what you get. Last, but not least, we have the DualShock 4. Now, if you're on a PC, you actually have a lot if choices, however, on the PS4, it's pretty much this or a Scuf. Now, on the PC, you can get the DualShock 4 to work and of course, it's not a bad controller, but it's gonna require some work. Like the Xbox controller, if your computer has Bluetooth, you can pair it that way and otherwise, you can pick up the wireless adapter or use a USB cable, however, unlike the Xbox controller, it is not natively supported in Windows, so what that means is either you have to rely on a couple of rare games that actually natively support it, which is not easy to find or you need to use a program such as DS4 for Windows. Now, that's gonna let this emulate an Xbox 360 controller and as you can see, it works just fine once you get it set up, but it is not as smooth as just plugging it in and getting it going, like the Xbox One, so what is the best game controller. Now, if you hadn't noticed, I didn't include every controller of all time and that's for good reason, these are my favorites, however, if I had to pick just one, it would be the standard Xbox One. This controller, I feel like, is a really nice sweet spot of something that's nice and comfortable to use, that has a lot of cool features. It works pretty much everywhere that you'd want to game. If you had a little bit more money to spend, the Elite controller is a good option, but my biggest problem with it is that while I do prefer it to the Xbox controller, it's triple the price and honestly, it's hard to justify, so I'm curious, what's your guys' favorite controller? Definitely be sure to let me know in the comments below and of course, if you guys wanna check out any of the ones I took a look at in this video, the links will be in the description. Anyway, guys, thank you so much for watching and I will catch you in the next one.",Food and Entertaining,Recipes,Make Game Controller Cookies,True,10350,en,en
30mzPmm7gvg,CANDY BAR CONTROLLERS - NERDY NUMMIES,"Hey guys, it’s Ro! Welcome to another Nerdy Nummies! Today we are gonna be making something super easy mode! I went online and I found these really cute Video Game Controllers. I’ll put a link down below if you want to check ‘em out! But I have a lot of friends who love video gaming, and their birthdays are coming up. So I thought, let’s make some chocolate classic controllers! Let’s get started! The things you will need, will be: Some chocolate, you can use dark chocolate, white chocolate, I’m using milk chocolate because it’s my favorite! But you can use whatever you like. And then for fillings, I’m choosing caramel, nuts, and some chopped up candy bars, I’m gonna be chopping up Twix, but for the filings, you can pick whatever you like. If you want to add Rice Krispies, that will kind of taste like a crunch bar, so you can get creative with it! You will also need your video game controller mold, a little baking brush, some plastic baggies, I’m using a pipe bag, but you can use a sandwich bag around the house, little elastic ties to tie them off with, and some toothpicks. Let’s put ‘em all together! The first thing that we’re gonna do is chop up some of our fillings. We’re gonna chop up our peanuts, and candy bar of choice. So I’m gonna take all these nuts, put them on a cutting board. I’m just nuts about baking! Then you’re gonna take a sharp cutting knife, and we’re just gonna chop, chop, chop, chop, chop! Now you’re gonna open up your candy bar, and we’re gonna chop ‘em up again. Finely chop them. Now that we’ve got 2 of our fillings chopped up, we are gonna heat up our chocolate and caramel! Ding-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun! That’s my sugar high dance! After you’ve heated up your chocolate and it’s all melted, we are gonna pour it into this plastic bag for more control, so I’m just using a little spatula, and I’m just gonna pour it in here. Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo! Then you’re gonna take your little elastic tie and tie the bag together. Now’s the fun part! We’re gonna fill our molds! The first thing that we’re gonna do is put down a layer of chocolate, so you’re gonna fill it 1/3 full of chocolate. Also, this is where your little toothpicks come in handy, you can just poke-poke-poke-poke-poke-poke-poke! Because there’s lots of little designs and crevices, and this will allow the chocolate to move its way into all those little places. You’re gonna paint up the sides, and that is so your fillings do not fall out the sides. You want to completely surround your fillings with chocolate. Now that we are done filling these molds up, we are gonna put them in the freezer for 10 minutes to set, and then we’re gonna add our yummy feelings… Feelings? Fillings! These chocolates are 3 levels, the first level is chocolate, and then filling, which we’re doing right now, and then chocolate on the top again. OK, so let’s fill, first I’m gonna add little peanuts. Try to fill the candy about 2/3 full. And then I’m gonna add some Twix! Oooooh! What a yummy surprise! These will be so good! Last but not least we have our melted caramel, I’ve just put it in a little plastic bag for more control, and I’m just gonna snip the tip, bewp! And again, fill it 2/3 full. Now that we’ve got our candies filled, we are gonna add the 3rd and final layer of chocolate! It’s gonna seal up all the yummy treats inside. Seal the delicious deal! Lets step, you’re gonna our these in the freezer for 10 minutes again to let them set, and then they’re ready to serve! Ta-da! Here are our Chocolate Classic Controllers that we made today! I hope you guys liked ‘em! These were so fun and easy to make. And they’re the perfect gift to give somebody because you can customize them! Whatever their favorite little candies are, you can put ‘em inside. I’ll be posting lots of pictures of these little treats on Facebook, Tumblr, Instagram and Twitter! And if you guys make these, please send me pictures, I love seeing your baking creations, I get a big kick out of them! And if you guys have any other ideas for any other Nerdy Nummies, please let me know, leave me a comment down below and I will do my best to make it happen! Alright, thanks again you guys!

evQsOFQju08,Is Your Red The Same as My Red?,"Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. This appears blue. This appears yellow. And this appears green. Those of us with normal color vision can probably agree. But that doesn't change the fact that color is an illusion. Color, as we know it, does not exist in the outside world, beyond us, like gravity or protons do. Instead, color is created inside our heads. Our brains convert a certain range of the electromagnetic spectrum into color. I can measure the wavelength of radiation, but I can't measure or observe the experience of a color inside your mind. So, how do I know that when you and me look at a strawberry, and, in my brain, this perception occurs, which I call ""red,"" that, in your brain, a perception like this doesn't occur, which you have, of course, also learned to call red. We both call it red. We communicate effectively and walk away, never knowing just how different each of our internal experiences really were. Of course, we already know that not everybody sees color in exactly the same way. One example would be color blindness. But we can diagnose and discuss these differences because people with the conditions fail to see things that most of us can. Conceivably though, there could be ways of seeing that we use that cause colors to look differently in different people's minds, without altering their performances on any tests we could come up with. Of course, if that were the case, wouldn't some people think other colors look better than others? Or that some colors were more complimentary of others? Well, yeah, but doesn't that already happen? This matters because it shows how fundamentally, in terms of our perceptions, we are all alone in our minds. Let's say I met an alien from a far away solar system who, lucky enough, could speak English, but had never, and could never, feel pain. I could explain to the alien that pain is sent through A delta and C fibers to the spinal chord. The alien could learn every single cell and pathway and process and chemical involved in the feeling of pain. The alien could pass a biology exam about pain and believe that pain, to us, generally is a bad thing. But no matter how much he learned, the alien would never actually feel pain. Philosophers call these ineffable, raw feelings ""Qualia."" And our inability to connect physical phenomenon to these raw feelings, our inability to explain and share our own internal qualia is known as the ""Explanatory Gap."" This gap is confronted when describing color to someone who's been blind their entire life. Tommy Edison has never been able to see. He has a YouTube channel where he describes what being blind is like. It's an amazing channel. In one video he talks about colors and how strange and foreign of a concept it seems to him. Sighted people try to explain, for instance, that red is ""hot,"" and blue is ""cold."" But to someone who has never seen a single color, that just seems weird. And, as he explains, it has never caused him to finally see a color. Some philosophers, like Daniel Dennett, argue that qualia may be private and ineffable simply because of a failure of our own language, not because they are necessarily always going to be impossible to share. There may be an alien race that communicates in a language that causes colors to appear in your brain without your retina having to be involved at all. Or without you having to have ever needed to actually see the color yourself. Perhaps, even in English, he says, given millions and billions of words used in just the right way, it may be possible to adequately describe a color such that a blind person could see it for the first time. Or you could figure out that, once-and-for-all, yes or no, in fact, you and your friend do not see the same red. But for now it remains the case that we have no way of knowing if my red is the same as your red. Maybe one day our language will allow us to share and find out, or maybe it never will. I know it's frustrating to not have an answer, but the mere fact that you guys can ask me about my internal experiences, and the mere fact that I can ask my friends and we can all collectively wonder at the concept of qualia is quite incredible, and also quite human. Animals can do all sorts of clever things that we do. They can use tools, problem solve, communicate, cooperate, exhibit curiosity, plan for the future, and although we can't know for sure, many animals certainly act as if they feel emotions - loneliness, fear, joy. Apes have even been taught to use language to talk to us humans. It's a sort of sign language that they've used to do everything from answer questions, to express emotion, or even produce novel thoughts. Unlike any other animal, these apes are able to understand language and form responses at about the level of a 2.5 year old human child. But, there is something that no signing-ape has ever done. No ape has ever asked a question. Joseph Jordania's ""Who Asked the First Question?"" is a great read on this topic and it's available for free online. For as long as we've been able to use sign language to communicate with apes, they have never wondered out loud about anything that we might know that they don't. Of course, this does not mean that apes, and plenty of other animals, aren't curious. They obviously are. But, what is suggests is that they lack a ""Theory of Mind."" An understanding that other people have separate minds. That they have knowledge, access to information that you might not have. Even us humans aren't born with a ""theory of mind,"" and there's a famous experiment to test when a human child first develops a ""theory of mind."" It is called the ""Sally-Anne"" test. During the test, researchers tell children a story about Sally and Anne. Sally and Anne have a box and a basket in their room. They also happen to have a delicious cookie. Now, Sally takes the cookie and puts it inside the box, and then Sally leaves the room. While Sally is gone, Anne comes over to the box, takes the cookie out and puts the cookie inside the basket. Now, when Sally comes back, the researchers ask the children ""where will Sally look for the cookie?"" Obviously, Sally will look in the box. That's where she left it. She has no way of knowing what Anne did while she was gone. But until the age of about 4, children will insist that Sally will check the basket because, after all, that's where the cookie is. The child saw Anne move the cookie, so why wouldn't Sally also know? Young children fail to realize that Sally's mental representation of the situation, her access to information, can be different than their own. And apes who know sign language, but never ask us questions, are doing the same thing. They're failing to recognize that other individuals have similar cognitive abilities and can be used as sources of information. So, we are all alone with our perceptions. We are alone in our own minds. We can both agree that chocolate tastes good. But I cannot climb into your consciousness and experience what chocolate tastes like to you. I can never know if my red looks the same as your red. But I can ask. So, stay human, stay curious and let the entire world know that you are.

-ToIM0aREY8,Make Bright Christmas Ornaments in a Minute,"In a previous video we learned how to make these paper sticks to use for secret love notes or for fortune messages. We will take this same idea to make twist icicles. They look great as Christmas decorations. We can use different kinds of paper. Pull a strip about 2 inches wide. Aluminum foil has one side shinier than the other. Choose the side you prefer. In this case, the shiny side will be visible. Turn it over, and fold in half. This is a 12-inch strip. When folded, this is about 6-iches (15cm) By folding we make two layers, which makes it stronger. Place the skewer near the edge. Wrap the paper over the skewer, leaving extra here. and then we roll all the way. Once here we remove the skewer. Flatten the edge. Flatten an equal section just below, in the same direction. Flatten in the opposite direction. Move all the way down. To hung we can either punch a hole with a needle and hang it from a hook, like this one... or curl the end and hang it from the tree. I personally prefer hanging it from a hook because the ornament has a nice swing. Get a square 6 x 6 inches, fold in half, fold each edge to the center. Cut along here. We can do it by hand. Since this paper is thicker we can start rolling by using a pencil. We teach the paper to curl. Once it is curled we can use the skewer and repeat the process.

GsJpF0edPxw,10 Rubbing Alcohol Life Hacks You Need To Know,"- Do you instinctively reach for the rubbing alcohol when you have a sticker that just won't come off? Well there are so many more uses for rubbing alcohol than just one. Sometimes it's best to use the stuff we've had for generations, because new isn't always better. Today we've compiled a list of awesome uses for rubbing alcohol. Some of these you may know, while others certainly should be new. Let's get rubbing! Whether you use a manual toothbrush or an electric, You should be rinsing off your toothbrush daily and changing the toothbrush or toothbrush head every three months. If you're a little paranoid, and just want to ensure that your toothbrush stays clean, then sanitize it once per week in a solution of rubbing alcohol- preferably the wintergreen flavor. It's an inexpensive method, and you can buy it at most pharmacies or grocery stores. Simply pour fresh rubbing alcohol into an empty glass and place your brush head right in! Let it soak for at least five minutes, and then rinse the toothbrush thoroughly in water to eliminate any alcohol taste. Just flick off the excess moisture, and place the brush where it can thoroughly air dry without becoming into contact with other brushes. Have you ever accidentally grabbed the wrong marker or gotten permanent marker on something, and then struggled to get it off? Try using rubbing alcohol to remove those otherwise permanent marks. You can spray some directly on the marker, or apply to a reusable wipe and clean off the affected area. It works much better if you tackle the marker sooner rather than later. It's especially handy when cleaning dry erase boards. But also very useful for getting rid of permanent marker off walls. As well as counter jobs, plastic bins... Hey! A lot more. A quick rub of the alcohol with a microfiber cloth, and those lingering marks are gone for good. We may use showers to get clean, but without regular maintenance, they build up quite a bit of grime and soap scum themselves. Try this daily shower cleaner to ensure a squeaky clean sprinkling. Start by measuring out 1/2 a cup of rubbing alcohol, and using a funnel, pour it into a 32 oz spray bottle. Then measure out 1/2 a cup of hydrogen peroxide and funnel it into the bottle as well! Grab either white vinegar or dishwasher rinse aid and measure 1 tsp to add it to the mix. Finally, add 1-2 tsp of liquid dish soap. Top off the bottle with roughly 3 cups of water and lightly tip the bottle back and forth, to mix the ingredients. After you shower, simple mist some of the spray onto the shower walls and it helps to keep your shower cleaner, with less mold or mineral build up between deep cleanings. No heavy duty scrubbing is needed because the daily spray keeps things from getting too bad during the week. You're probably not aware, but most commercially sold windshield washer fluids contain methanol, which is not only poisonous and potentially harmful to humans, but it's also bad for the environment. Make your own all weather washer fluid instead with just a handful of common household ingredients. Start by filling an empty gallon container 3/4 of the way with water. Add 1 tsp of liquid dish soap, and 1/2 cup of white vinegar or ammonia. Top it off with our featured ingredient- rubbing alcohol. We highly suggest adding a few drops of blue food coloring to serve as a reminder, or warning, of what's inside. Also make sure to label your mixture and keep it out of the reach of children and pets. Because alcohol freezes at a much lower temperature than water, it can also be an effective de-icer in cold weather. You can pour mix into the windshield wiper fluid reservoir of your car and you're all set! This cost-effective mixture contains more natural ingredients, and eliminates the use of methanol. Which any way you look at it, is beneficial. Does someone in your household have shoes with a lingering foul smell? We've previously made an entire video dedicated to stopping shoe odors. From cat liter, to teabags, to wood chips, to lemon peels and baby powder! But as you've probably guessed, rubbing alcohol works just as well. Last time we told you to soak cotton balls in rubbing alcohol and stuff them in your stinky shoes. This time around, get rid of that less than desirable smell with just a few sprints of rubbing alcohol, and some sunshine. Kill that odor-causing bacteria and freshen up those stinky sneakers by spraying the offensively-foul insides and placing them outside in a sunny location. You'll be left with cleaner shoes, or at least shoes that are fresher than before. Perhaps you've heard of the trick of mixing rubbing alcohol to top off hand sanitizer to extend its use. Today we've got something even better. Commercial hand sanitizers are often so chemically scented that they're hard to tolerate. There's really no need for your nose and eyes to burn every time you use it. So, customize your own and make it from home. This recipe is naturally scented with powerful essential oils and a few other ingredients, including- you've guessed it, rubbing alcohol. Start by measuring 6 tbsp of aloe vera gel, and adding to a resealable bag. Then, 2 to 3 tbsp of 72.99% rubbing alcohol. The stronger the better in this situation. Next, add 1 tsp of Vitamin E oil, which helps soften hands and is the natural preservative to increase shelf life. Now add 15-20 drops of tea tree essential oil, which is well known for it's power antiseptic properties. Finish with any other antibacterial oils you prefer, such as peppermint, rosemary, sage, or lemon grass to counteract the smell. Combine all the ingredients together and mix well. If you prefer a thinner consistency, you can always add a little distilled water. Cut a corner off the bag and squeeze to easily transfer the hand sanitizer into a small container. It's perfect for throwing in your backpack or purse. This recipe fills a 3.4 oz travel-size bottle, with a shelf life of up to a year! Homemade sanitizer is that easy. If you find yourself cutting up onions or garlic and want to get rid of that potent smell from your hands, just rub on some rubbing alcohol. Or better yet, use some of that homemade hand sanitizer that you just created. This will get rid of that smell quickly, just be careful that you don't have any open wounds. That burn might be more insufferable than the odor on your hands. Not only do fake smelling commercial air fresheners never quite match their descriptions, but you'll find that many of them contain nasty chemicals as well. Next time you're tempted to grab one of those brightly colored spray cans, grab some rubbing alcohol, water, essential oils, and a spray bottle instead. Start by combining 1/2 a cup of water, and 1/2 a cup of rubbing alcohol into an empty 8-12 oz spray bottle. Then, depending on how strong you want the scent, add 15-25 drops of essential oils of your choice. You should experiment to find a mix that you really like. We chose peppermint and lavender. Ah, beautiful. Give your spritzer a good shake before you spray. The alcohol will help the essential oils and water mix more effectively, and helps the all natural air freshener evaporate faster. Now just simply spray around for instant freshness. Keep in mind that just like any other air freshener, essential oils can be potentially harmful to pets, especially cats. So keep them away from them. Did you know that vinegar, lemon juice, and any other asset will eat away at your granite countertops? Basically the harsher the cleaner, the quicker it will break down the sealing. Hot water and dish soap is adequate for daily sanitizing, but for a stronger disinfectant, mix together a 1:1 solution of 91% isopropyl alcohol and water. You can also add 5-10 drops of your favorite essential oil to mask the alcohol smell. Now give it a few shakes to mix it altogether, and test it out. Spray it onto the granite and allow it to sit for three to five minutes. Finish by drying with a clean microfiber cloth to give your countertops a beautiful, streak-free shine. This homemade granite cleaner works great on appliances too, and all at a fraction of the cost of the store bought stuff. Got a boo-boo? Turn kitchen sponges into a cheap reusable ice pack in just a few basic steps. Start by soaking a sponge in water, and place it in a resealable sandwich bag. Add some rubbing alcohol to the wet sponge. This is gonna add a gel-like consistency that will mold to your body better and retain a cool temperature for longer. Place the bag and it's contents inside a second bag to contain any leakage. Place the bag inside the freezer, and after an hour or so the mixture should be at the right texture. It gets really cold, but never quite hardens, so you can manipulate it's shape making it ideal for those occasional bumps and bruises. Now obviously there's tons of things you can do with rubbing alcohol. So if you've got your own nifty tips and tricks, let us know in the comments as we'd love to see them. Be sure you're subscribed as you'll love what we've got coming next. Thank you so much for watching, and we'll see ya next time.",Hobbies and Crafts,Crafts,Clean with Rubbing Alcohol,True,9102,en,en

Today's the first one and every Wednesday this month you're going to get a new one, so look forward to that. So far we've discussed wardrobe, makeup. Today's video is dedicated to fragrances, perfumes, which is a topic that French women take very seriously. I would like to show you how we apply perfume, dos and don'ts in general. I will also explain how we integrate perfume in the overall beauty routine and why my country is so famous for its fragrances. Actually, I'm going to start with that. Why is french perfume so famous? There is a small town in the South of France called Glasse. This little town has been providing Paris and the courts and the kings of all Europe with perfume for hundreds of years, so all the know-how and the craftsmanship is concentrated in that little area in the South. All the noses of the Luxury houses you can think of have learned there, even today. The nose is the job title of the perfume creator. There is only one per house at a time, not more. So there is one at Hermès, there is one at Guerlain, etc.. That individual is extremely valuable to a company because if he can create a perfume that becomes a ""classic"", a ""timeless"" fragrance, It's going to bring multi-million euros to the company. It's a huge business. Anyways, Glasse and the area around it has excellent weather, great sun conditions, and that's perfect for flowers. If you drive through the region in your car, you're going to see fields and fields of mimosa, tuberose, orange trees, and the orange blossom from that tree is for instance extremely appreciated in fragrance making. In the past, perfumes were made out of flowers; distilled. So perfume makers found in Glasse the best for materials they could think of, and that still goes on today. From distilled flowers to modern perfume. Today, perfume makers use natural but also synthetic ingredients mixed together, so if you're good, when you smell the fragrance, you might recognize a note or two, a flower or two, but as a whole it has a smell [that] you couldn't find like that in nature. The first ""synthetic perfume"" very well known and early on the market was Chanel No. 5. Do you know why it's called Chanel No. 5? [Chuckles] Gabrielle Chanel had, at the end of the process, little bottles, numbered to pick a winner from, and she said I'm just going to pick my lucky number, so she picked number five. The perfume was also launched on the fifth of May, which is the fifth month of the year, 1921, and that brought good luck indeed because to this day it's, every year, on top of the bestseller list in every single store. What's the difference between parfum, eau de toilette, etc.? If you smell Chanel No. 5 or fragrances from that time you'll notice that they're all extremely strong and not all women wanted to wear something that strong. So little by little, fragrance makers learnt and started to develop lighter versions. Now, you basically have three main levels. Parfum is the highest concentration. That one does not leave you, ever. You can't get rid of it, anymore. The intermediary concentration- a bit more diluted- is called eau de parfum and the lightest one is called eau de toilette. That one will disappear eventually, after six hours depending on the acidity level of your skin, but it will eventually disappear so you'll need to reapply. Eau de toilette is the most commonly worn today because people say the smell of your fragrance should not overpower the smell of your food otherwise, you cannot enjoy your food anymore. We've got our priorities quite right in my country. [Chuckles] Also, since the 20th century, people have running water in their houses and can clean themselves regularly. We don't need perfume to hide our own body smell anymore. Sounds gross, but hey- there was no daily bath in Versailles. You know what I mean? How to apply perfume? In France, there are two clubs, two schools of thought: The first one says you apply perfume delicately onto your strategic body points. The first one is the inside of the wrist, not too close to the hands, because you're going to wash them, so you want the perfume to stay a bit longer. Then, behind the ears, here, or here on the neck, underneath the jawline. That's for when you kiss people [Smooching] French way, so they can smell you. Then, the inside of the elbow if you want to smell stronger, and, not to forget, behind the knees. That's for when you walk past people who are seated, in summer, so they can smell you, too. Everything is completely thought through. Important to remember is that you should never rub perfume. It is already on the points that are hotter than the rest of your body because the skin is thinner on those areas, so it's heating up the perfume anyway and it's going to go into the room thanks to that. If you rub on top, you're overheating the perfume. It's breaking the molecules and it's going to change for worse, the smell of the perfume later, so you want to avoid that. The second school of thought says- very easy- perfume should not be touched at all. So you spray a cloud into the room in front of you, [Spritzing] And then you walk through the cloud to catch the molecules, if that makes sense. [Laughter] It's not rocket science, but everybody will tell you the same thing. The good thing about that is that then your hair smells, too and when your hair is moving, when it's windy, wherever you're going today, then it's really nice to smell for people who follow you. But if you use this method, you will need to reapply a bit more often during the day because it's going to vanish away faster. For that purpose, many brands now offer a solid version of the liquid perfume that you have at home so you can carry it around in your purse and use it anytime during the day. That's one by Fragonard: one of the most famous houses in Glasse. I bought it there. It's orange blossom, in beeswax, so it's actually more traditional fragrance. It does smell like nature. I don't wear this one. I put it in the box with all my pens and tools, so every morning when I open the box, it smells like the South of France. It's fabulous. [Laughter] Which type of perfume would french women actually wear? I would say, definitely, it evolves throughout a lifetime. Every Frenchy I know would probably agree with that statement. Young women go for sweet things: brands like Mugler. Angel is a typical teenager or young women fragrance. Cacharel: That's a brand I used to wear. When I smell it now on somebody else, I think oof-- --way too sweet! My God! Ha! I can't stand it anymore. And then, growing up, women turn away from light... sweet, light, flowery fragrances and turn towards more intense scents, like sandalwood or like tuberose; deeper types of jasmine flowers, etc.. If you walk through a perfume store in France, you will hear women trying things on and saying I'm too young for that one. Fragrances for different age targets smell very different indeed in French houses. Usually french women own more than one perfume so they can actually pick from a whole range based on the occasion, the day, the mood. My basic one is Chloe Eau de Toilette: That's a classic. It's a top seller so I also know that I'll be able to refill when that bottle is over. It's my third or fourth one already. It's good for any setting, kind of. It's not too heavy. It's not flowery, because I don't like it. It's somewhere in between and it works pretty much all the time. When I need a confidence kick, I use Chanel No. 5 Eau de Toilette. That's something I would match with my men's shoes and on those days, I can swear, people take me more seriously. Really! Perfume is a weapon and French women know that very well. But, here, I also have to say it took me years before I felt ready and grown-up enough to actually be allowed to wear Chanel No. 5, even though I stick to the eau de toilette, because it's such a symbol. Those fragrances from big houses come with such an image behind them that they're not easy to support, I have to say. Then, I have a couple more playful ones that I would not use up the whole bottle of, so I usually get those in mini sizes. Saint Laurent is typically one that does great sets of five or six little fragrances so you can switch up based on the mood. All of them are quite heavy, but I'd wear that to go out, for instance. How is perfume integrated into the beauty routine? Your perfume is you: it stands for you, and usually you spend a lot of time finding the one. So, all the rest of your beauty products have to work around it and adapt. So French women would typically not wear coconut-flavored body cream or watermelon lip gloss or something, because imagine when you add perfume on top of that, strong perfume... horrible! That's why French cosmetics usually have very decent, discreet scents: it's to not compete with your perfume. Another thing: You wouldn't wear perfume every day of the week because the nose gets used to it, and after some time you can't notice it anymore and you feel like you have to increase the spray to still be able to smell it. At the price of the bottle, you want to notice when you're wearing it, and you want to enjoy it, so you typically hear women saying oh, not today or this week, I'm on a perfume break. I'm not wearing any. When French women wear their perfumes, they fully appreciate it as the luxury that it is. Now you know the whole philosophy behind French women wearing perfume. Finding the right one is a bit like finding your style in fashion: It's fun, but takes a while. [Laughter] Now I'm curious. Do you wear perfume? What's yours? What's the history behind? Why? See you on Wednesday and Sunday, every week. Here's some perfume for the wait. Bye, bye.",Hobbies and Crafts,Crafts,Sew a Scented Shoe Stuffer,True,9900,en,en
S01BraoYMr0,Growing Winter Jasmine (Jasminum polyanthum),"Hi, my name is Byron Martin, and today we're going to be talking about 'Jasmine polyanthum,' or the Winter Jasmine. Right now, we are at the beginning of March, and our plants are coming into full bloom. The reason why they are flowering is that they have been subjected to a period of chill. And, that chill-period is below 60 degrees; and above freezing. And they, actually, can take a little bit below freezing; but we never let them go that far. The key to flowering this jasmine is to subject them to that cool period, for a period of weeks. And, it's not just a short dip. It has to be consistent; night after night, they're dropping down-- this particular house we're in drops down into the forties at night. And it happens over a period of probably two or three months. So, what we do with our Jasmines is, we grow them during the summertime as vegetative cuttings. They're potted into baskets, or they can be trained on trellis. And during the summertime, they're given full sun... They're watered properly: meaning a little dryness, and water is given to them throughout the summertime... Fertilized. And then, as we go into fall, we try to subject them to that cool, that comes along, as we go into October, November, and December. And, if we have an early fall, where the temperatures are cool, and we protect them from the freezing, the buds will form, even before Christmas time. This year happened to be one of those years, where we were able to get our buds formed, even before Christmas. We could see the little buds forming on the tips. These plants, here, are in full bud, right now, and the flowers. But, the buds actually form at the leaf axis. And, as you go into that chill-period, you'll see these little shoots starting to form, here, and then little buds starting to form outside of that. The important thing, when you're growing this for flowers-- for winter flowers-- is not to --once you see that initiation of bud-- not to put them into heat. And, that heat, again, would be temperatures above 60 at night. Now, daytime temperatures, it doesn't really matter too much; you're going to get warm days in the greenhouse, or even outside, in the fall. But, it's that bringing the bud down, into that cold temperature, and letting it rest there for the night time, and then coming back out of it. So, once you see bud formation, you need to hold them in that cold until the buds have really expressed themselves; you're starting to see, actually, the forms of bracts, and so on. And then, if you move them into heat, that just forces the flowering cycle. As far as fertilizer goes, we use a balanced feed on them. And, once we get into the cooler temperatures of fall, we discontinue feeding them. You can actually get salt build-up if you continued. And, they can't utilize it as well under colder temperatures. As far as pruning goes-- what we'll do with the basket, like this, once it's finished flowering-- this is about halfway through-- we'll give it a really hard cut. We'll cut it way down. Now, we will leave some stems on it, and maybe a little bit of foliage, but this whole plant will be brought back to just the crook- the initial branching structure that was there when we started. This is a plant that's going through its second year. So, it can go through its third year with a good, hard cut, once it's done flowering. Then you can cut it, actually, during the summertime, if needed. Generally, what we do is, we keep wrapping it around itself, so it becomes this big ball. But, you can do some pruning during summertime. Just got to remember that, you want, probably, by the time you get into July, you want to stop that. And, you want to let those branches, or leads, fill out-- because that's where your flowers are going to form, as you go into fall. When growing Jasmine polyanthum, you want to make sure that you give it as maximum amount of light as possible. And, even during the wintertime. Now, this makes it a little more challenging. But, even during the wintertime, it wants to be in a sunny window, or a sunny exposure, so that the plant itself can continue growing and continuing forming buds. It's not really a shade-loving plant. They will grow in lower light; they just don't flower as well. So, the maximum amount of bloom you're going to get out of them, is grown under full light. Another interesting aspect of this plant: if grown under very cold temperatures, and very cold would be down in the thirties at night. Under really bright, sunny conditions, the buds actually form pink, as before they come out, which actually adds a little more color to it. Because, you can see this plant is totally white. And this was actually grown in this greenhouse, where we didn't get quite that cold. There's a little bit of information on how to grow our Jasmine polyanthum. It's actually a very vigorous, and easy plant to grow. Just got to remember: adjust your temperatures as you go into fall.

b8gdlq28CAQ,Homemade Corn Tortillas | A Sweet Pea Chef,"Hey there, Lacey here with A Sweet Pea Chef, and I've got a game changer of a recipe to share. Today, we're gonna make homemade clean corn tortillas. And you know what that means, that means we can have clean enchiladas, tacos, burritos, tortilla chips and more. So let's get started. First, we need to find a clean masa harina. If you've never heard of that before, it's basically translated from Spanish into dough flour. And what that is, is dried corn and then processed with a little bit of lime juice and mixed together, dried again and ground up into a flour. Look for masa harina that only contains corn and lime. Remember, we're all about simple ingredients around here. In a large bowl, combine the masa harina and sea salt together and then we're gonna pour in hot water and freshly squeezed lime juice into the masa mixture and stir with a spoon, forming a big ball. The dough should look firm and springy when touched, not dry and super sticky. If you need to add a little bit more water, just go ahead and do that in small batches until you reached the right consistency. Now, cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or napkin and let the dough rest for about an hour. Grab about a golf ball-sized chunk from the rested masa and form it into a ball by rolling it in the palm of your hands. Dust a folded sheet of parchment paper or wax paper with a little bit of the dry masa and then place the masa ball in the center. Gently flatten the ball either using a rolling pin or a tortilla press after folding the parchment paper over. Now, gently remove that flattened masa from the parchment paper and transfer to a hot griddle or fry pan and cook for about 30 seconds to a minute. You're looking for golden brown spots, but you're not wanting to overcook them, so keep a close eye on the tortillas. Flip the tortilla over and cook on the other side for another 30 seconds to a minute. Then, repeat with the remaining dough or if you wanna save it for later, you can always roll the dough into the balls, put them into an airtight container and then place them in the fridge for about three to four days, and then you can have fresh tortillas anytime you want. I hope you're as excited as I am to have an easy, simple and clean homemade corn tortilla recipe under your belt. Thanks so much for watching.

4g11lhs5l4k,Let's build a wheel with no tools!,"Arguably the most specialized area of bike repair is wheel building. You need to know about spoke types, spoke lengths, hubs, rims, rim sizes, lacing, truing, dishing, and a variety of measurements that would make your head spin. Not to mention the expensive specialty tools like truing stands, nipple drivers, spoke wrenches, and dishing gauges. It’s no wonder that some bike shops outsource their wheel repair to specialists. Just carrying the parts is a challenge. To me, wheel builders are like heart surgeons. So, I came up with a terrible challenge: Swap a rim with no specialty tools other than a spoke wrench. We’re not starting with a pile of parts though. I actually do have a bent wheel here which needs a new hoop. First we’ll remove the brake rotor to expose the side of the hub. I said I’d only use a spoke wrench, but I don’t think a torx driver counts as a wheel building tool. In an attempt to make my life slightly easier I’m tying all these spokes together with string. For an experienced mechanic this wouldn’t make things easier at all, but for me it takes the complexity out of lacing the wheel back up. Now I’m removing all of the spoke nipples, which would be way way easier with a nipple driver. I feel like my hand is going to fall off and I haven’t even started fastening the new rim. You can sorta use a screwdriver for this, but it doesn’t have the little point in the middle that keeps it centered. It’s harder than you would think. Now to lace the new hoop on. Even with the spokes tied together this is not easy. In fact, I almost wish I left the string off. This part of the process wouldn’t have been too bad, but I got a few of the nipples stuck inside the rim. To get them back out, some wheels are worse than other. A few times I considered just sawing the rim open and quitting mountain biking. I tried tweezers, magnets, you name it. The only thing that works is shaking the wheel for 20 minutes and hoping for a miracle. Now that I have all my hardware back, the wheel is at least put together. Now it needs to be trued so that all of the spokes have even tension. Since I’m doing this with no tools, I’ll use the front fork and some zip ties. If you’ve never trued a wheel before, it’s basically a matter of finding the biggest bow in the wheel, tightening the spoke on the opposite side of it lightly, and then repeating the process until the wheel is straight. Although it might look straight, we still need to align this rim with the hub laterally. This part is called dishing. Dishing is normally done with a gauge, or even a properly calibrated truing stand. Since I don’t have either, I’ll be using a trick I saw on a forum. Basically, I’m setting a reference point on one side of the wheel, flipping it over, and making sure the hub face is the same distance from the rim on both sides. It’s not. It’s off tremendously. Because it’s off by so much, I’m going to tighten every spoke on the right side, and loosen every spoke on the left side one half turn. 30 minutes later and a couple more passes around the wheel, and I’m as close as we’re gonna get with my homemade precision dishing gauge. One more tedious truing and we’re finally done. That took me over 3 hours and I regret it thoroughly. There’s a little jump in the rim too. It won’t be noticeable while riding, but I’ll know it’s there and it’ll bother me. There are scratches all over my brand new Easton Arc rim, and the nipples look like they’ve been through some kind of S&amp;M clamping ritual. I don’t know what tool I missed the most. Obviously the truing stand would have helped, as a properly calibrated one can pretty much do the whole job. Not only that, but it provides a nice mount at eye level for working on the wheel. The other part that killed me was not having a nipple driver. If you’ve ever smashed your hand in a car door, then you know what it feels like to build a whole friggin wheel with just a spoke wrench. Let’s also consider that I was building a front wheel, which is easier than a rear since it’s pretty much centered over the hub. A rear wheel is offset even more to account for the cassette, so my terrible experience was actually the best case scenario. I could have used really nice tools, and the help of an experienced mechanic, but I thought this video would be useful those who wanted to save a few bucks. Actually, how many bucks are we saving? $35? Ugh… Even if your local shop charges twice this, I can’t recommend doing it yourself without the proper tools and knowledge. The risk of you screwing it up and costing yourself more money is just too great. I hope that at least, this was worth the entertainment. Thanks for riding with me today, and I’ll see you next time.",Cars & Other Vehicles,Bicycles,True Wheels of a Bicycle,True,4721,en,en

8nHBGFKLHZQ,What if there was a black hole in your pocket?,"What would happen to you if a black hole the size of a coin suddenly appeared near you? Short answer: you’d die. Long answer: it depends. Is it a black hole with the mass of a coin, or is it as wide as a coin? Suppose a US nickel with the mass of about 5 grams magically collapsed into a black hole. This black hole would have a radius of about 10 to the power of −30 meters. By comparison, a hydrogen atom is about 10 to the power of −11 meters. So the black hole compared to an atom is as small as an atom compared to the Sun. Unimaginably small! And a small black hole would also have an unimaginably short lifetime to decay by Hawking radiation. It would radiate away what little mass it has in 10 to the power of −23 seconds. Its 5 grams of mass will be converted to 450 terajoules of energy, which will lead to an explosion roughly 3 times bigger than the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined. In this case, you die. You also lose the coin. If the black hole had the diameter of a common coin, then it would be considerably more massive. In fact, a black hole with the diameter of a nickel would be slightly more massive than the Earth. It would have a surface gravity a billion billion times greater than our planet currently does. Its tidal forces on you would be so strong that they’d rip your individual cells apart. The black hole would consume you before you even realized what’s happening. Although the laws of gravity are still the same, the phenomenon of gravity that you’d experience would be very different around such dense objects. The range of the gravitational attraction extends over the entire observable universe, with gravity getting weaker the farther away you are from something. On Earth right now, your head and your toes are approximately the same distance from the center of our planet. But if you stood on a nickel-sized black hole, your feet would be hundreds of times closer to the center, and the gravitational force would be tens of thousands of times as large as the force on your head and rip you into a billion pieces. But the black hole wouldn’t stop with just you. The black hole is now a dominant gravitational piece of the Earth–Moon–Black-Hole-of-Death system. You might think that the black hole would sink towards the center of the planet and consume it from the inside out. In fact, the Earth also moves up onto the black hole and begins to bob around, as if it were orbiting the black hole, all while having swathes of mass eaten with each pass, which is much more creepy. As the Earth is eaten up from the inside, it collapses into a scattered disk of hot rock, surrounding the black hole in a tight orbit. The black hole slowly doubles its mass by the time it’s done feeding. The Moon’s orbit is now highly elliptical. The effects on the Solar system are awesome— in the Biblical sense of awesome, which means terrifying. Tidal forces from the black hole would probably disrupt the near-Earth asteroids, maybe even parts of the asteroid belt, sending rocks careening through the Solar system. Bombardment and impacts may become commonplace for the next few million years. The planets are slightly perturbed, but stay approximately in the same orbit. The black hole we used to call Earth will now continue on orbiting the Sun in the Earth’s place. In this case, you also die. This bonus video was made possible by your contributions on Patreon.

2JW9OZK1gN0,Honey Lemon Ginger Tea | Cold & Flu Remedy,"- Hello, beautiful people. Today on Bachelor on a Budget we are making honey, lemon, and ginger tea. This concoction has great nutritional properties that are gonna help the soreness in our throat. Honey is both antibacterial and antifungal. Ginger has a long history as a medicine, as a pain reliever, and for inflammation. And lemon has a bunch of vitamin C and other nutrients. And, altogether, these taste delicious. So, all you're gonna need is some ginger, some honey, some lemons, and a sterilized jar. Let's get started and soothe our throats. For this size jar, we're going to use two lemons and about that much ginger. We'll cut our lemon down to size. You can remove the ends or any seeds. Next is our ginger. We're just gonna peel this with a spoon. Ginger is one of those ingredients that you kind of want to get organic. Because it has a very thin skin and so it contains the most pollutants when it's non-organic, especially if you're buying it from China. Okay, then fill that. Little lemon, little ginger, little lemon, little ginger, little lemon. Let's shove that down. Now, we wanna add our honey. I had to warm mine up a bit, 'cause it wasn't quite fully liquid. And put a lid on that. And that will last a few weeks in the fridge, but you'll probably go through it a lot faster. This stuff also makes great gifts, but, yeah, it's really great for the throat. So, you add it with a bit of hot water or even a bit of cold water. Let's give this a taste. And you can always add more honey, if you'd like. Some hot water. And voila. We got our beautiful jar of lemon, honey, and ginger. This is really delicious and it already feels way better on my throat. You can feel the honey kind of coating. I love this stuff. So, that's why I make kind of a bulk version of it. That's about five, six servings, depending on how much you like, how sweet you like it, how flavorful. Yeah, give this a shot. Little bonus things you can add to this is some tumeric. Tumeric is a great addition. Or a little cayenne pepper. Both add a bunch of nutritional properties and flavor.

KfnyopxdJXQ,How To Make a Paper Crane: Origami Step by Step - Easy,"hello, I'm going to show you how to make a paper origami Crane and What I'm gonna do different in this tutorial is I'm going to use highlighters to Emphasize and illustrate each crease so it's just gonna be a little bit easier step-By-step for and maybe the first time or if you're new to do an origami so first you're gonna need either origami paper or Printer paper that you can make into a square and which we want to do to do that is basically take this corner and fold It down along that Edge and then take a pair of scissors and Cut the excess paper off just like that And then when you open it back up You have a perfect square, and then this is going to be the first of your fold you're going to want to do So I'll go ahead and illustrate this one On the next slide this fold you're going to take the other corner and two And fold it the other way Just like that And then now you want to flip it over And you're going to fold it now into in half the other way to basically two rectangles And then you'll want to do it the other way as well So now on this side now have a folds basically going the other way and Then once you get to this point. You're Gonna want to Tilt it like that and these two folds right here It's going to kind of naturally want to come together, and you want to fold along those edges and bring these two points Inward down to the bottom and then when you do that at the top Hold those crease down just like that, so then now you have the square basically. They're kind of like four little triangular flanges coming out, and then you want to always keep the flaps on the bottom And then now for the next step once you get that creased real good if you want to take this corner right here this edge and Match along the center crease you have right here basically just fold these in And then once you do that flip it over and do the same thing on the other side I'm going to go ahead and illustrate those for you and actually there's one more thing one. So you get those folded on both sides And the step isn't necessary, but I like to do it as an extra Step is when you take the top part right here And give it just a little bit of a crease on top and that'll help help guide a fold later on Then you want to go ahead and open up all four sides. I'm going to illustrate all these for you You'll fold their fold and fold down Right there and the crease we did Right on top and so now Go ahead and illustrate the unit side fold Just like that, so you have folded like this And when you did that also full of the inside which then what you want to do is take this bottom flap? and push it up and Crease it right there where this fold is and then on the two inside creases basically fold those in Crease the bottom and then just kind of let this fall together into a crease just like that and then flip it over and Do the same thing and then you're gonna want to take this and Kinda. Just give it a little bit of crease the other way And open it up now along these two folds right here. Oh Fold those in and let this all just kind of fall together. Just like that crease it real good And once you have that you'll see the split part down at the bottom. I'm gonna keep that there and now what you're going to want to do is take the Corner Edges and this right here and fold it in to the center. Just like this get on both sides It looks just like that Then fold it up. I'll flip it over and do the same two folds just Like that so it looks like that Well, then now you don't want to take the two flaps pinch them together At the same time pinch the other two together, so you're basically just inverting what you have and You'll get what looks like this and then from there look I already see a little bit of a crease right here Go on to fold up these parts on both sides flip it over fold it up there at the bottom and then now Basically invert it again so pinch these two together and pinch the back two together just Like that so then you'll get this and then down at the bottom fold these over to get your wings Same thing on the other side And now you can see you have the wings and the last second last step we want to take these and along this edge right here, basically just kind of pull them out and Then pinch it and refold it right along that edge Same thing on this side then last step I'm gonna take the four the head basically push this down and pinch it in Just like that and there you have it you have a origami Crane",Hobbies and Crafts,Crafts,Make Origami Paper,True,4458,en,en
w8I25H3bnNw,What if the Moon was a Disco Ball?,"Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. If we turned the Moon into a giant disco ball, day and night would not be a disco party. Instead of diffusely reflecting sunlight onto all of us, a mirror-tiled moon would reflect specularly. You would be lucky to momentarily catch a single reflected beam of sunlight. Now, with the help visuals by Nick from Yeti Dynamics, who you should subscribe to immediately, let's see what would occur if a disco ball moon actually happened. Here's the Earth with an imaginary screen behind it, so we can track the path of reflections from a disco ball Moon. It's 3,012 mirror tiles are ten kilometres thick and between 100 and 150 kilometres across. And, as you can see, the beams of sunlight they reflect would only intersect with Earth briefly and rarely - a few every month or so would race past at more than 20,000 kilometers a second. From the surface of Earth, they'd just be tiny flashes in the sky 0.1 percent as bright as the regular Sun and would last a fraction of a second. The Earth, Sun and Moon just aren't an ideal locations for disco ball effects. But, if our disco ball moon was closer and orbited earth not 384,000 kilometers away but less than 450, as far as the International Space Station does, it would be torn apart by gravitational title forces. Shoot. Also, the Moon doesn't really rotate from our perspective like a fun disco ball. It liberates, but it's starting to look like instead of an awesome lunar party decoration, a disco ball moon would just be a lunar party pooper. So, for the sake of investigation, let's allow this disco ball Moon to not be torn apart and allow it to spin in the sky. Now we're talking. Occasionally we would get glittery reflections of a dimmer image of the Sun. From the surface of Earth, this is what we would see. You know, being able to see Earth reflected is almost cooler. It's like being a bacterium on a giant's face who's looking into a mirror. You can see the giant, but not yourself. It kinda makes you feel small. But it would be a great way to take planetary selfies. So, let's watch a mirror the width of the Moon orbit as close as the ISS does. From the surface of Earth, it would look like this. The strobe lights around the edge, by the way, are ten kilometres across. Pretty cool. Now finally, let's take a look at the Moon as a rotating disco ball from low orbit. The Moon is not a disco ball and likely never will be. It's just a diffuse source of illumination. But it's illuminating in a different way to imagine what would occur if that actually happened. Woah. And as always, thanks for watching.",Hobbies and Crafts,Collecting,Use Mirrors to Create More Space,True,2596,en,en-GB

jN-FfJKgis8,What if the Earth were Hollow?,"Flying in a 747 from one side of the earth to the exact opposite side would take about 22 hours… and while I know there's a bit of rock in the way, that's really going the long way round. So what if we did dig a hole all the way through the earth, through the center, and jumped in? Well, Michael, you probably would't make it very far - that's because of the Coriolis effect (which is why a ball curves weirdly when you toss it while riding a merry go round and why hurricanes always spin counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere). At the equator, the earth (and you on it) is rotating eastwards at 1670 km/hr. As you go deeper, the bits of earth around you are still spinning around once per day, but they don't have as far to travel so they're going at slower and slower speeds. If you jumped into a vertical shaft, you'd soon be traveling east faster than the rock around you so that after falling only a few kilometers, you'd crash into the eastern wall. It might not be a disaster, but some miners near Lake Superior tried to test this by dropping cannon balls down a mile-long shaft - and the balls never reached the bottom. OK, so what if the tunnel went from pole to pole, so the Coriolis effect didn't apply, and let's also assume that there's no air resistance, or friction Ok. Since the earth's mass is more concentrated close to the middle, gravity would pull you down with roughly the same amount of force for the first 3000 km, or halfway to the center of the earth - this familiar, constant force would accelerate you until you were falling 8km every second, and the trip halfway to the middle of the earth would only take 13 minutes. Soon after, you'd reach the earth's outer core, and this is the point in your journey where the pull of gravity would be strongest - but only slightly stronger than the force we're used to on the surface. As you continued to fall closer to the center, so much of the earth's mass would now be above you that it would begin to seriously cancel out the attraction of the mass below, and the pull would weaken until you reached the center. Here, you'd experience no gravitational pull at all - or rather, the earth would be pulling on you the same amount in all directions, so you could float freely around with no sense of ""up"" or ""down"". Except, remember, that you'd be speeding past at 22,000 miles per hour, or 6 miles a second. Once you passed the center, the whole process would reverse and you'd gradually slow, pulled down (or is it up?) weakly at first and then more strongly, until when you got to the other side, you'd stop moving and could step out on the surface, a mere 37 minutes, or one dryer cycle, later. Of course, the deepest we've ever been able to dig is the Kola Superdeep borehole in Russia. But it only went down 12km, which is only two thirds the length of Manhattan. They had to stop because it got too hot: 180°C. And this is sort of the problem with digging a hole through earth - earth is hot, and molten in the middle. You can't just dig a hole through it with shovels. But here's a question: wasn't the middle of earth wasn't all ""liquidy"", what if earth was hollow, but weighed the same? Well, with its entire mass concentrated in a thin shell right under our feet, the earth wouldn't have a magnetic field any more, because that comes from the molten iron core. So we'd be totally vulnerable to radiation from the solar wind and storms, and this means we'd see the aurora EVERYWHERE. Look! The NorthernSouthernEastern lights! And if you jumped inside the hollow earth to escape the solar storm? Well, gravity from the different parts of the spherical earth-shell would perfectly cancel out and you'd float freely about inside as if the earth weren't there at all! Of course, you'd better bring a space suit, because there's not nearly enough air ON earth to fill up the entire INSIDE of earth. But what if the entire inside of the hollow earth were covered with mirrors? Henry, that's ridiculous… for now Ok, so back outside of the earth, we wouldn't really notice much difference from a gravitational perspective - falling things would still accelerate at 9.8 m/s^2, a baseball would follow the same trajectory, and the moon would follow the same orbit around the earth. Hey Henry, let's go to outer space, right now. Bring your gun - this'll all make sense later. C'mon. Oh, and you're coming too.

TI7XTC2ew0k,Can you Turn Coal/Carbon in to Diamonds with Hydraulic Press,"Welcome to hydraulic press channel today we are going to at least try make some diamonds, this is our viewer request we have got really many comments about can you make diamonds with the press and, I think that if you can they would be a bit cheaper but we are at least going to try And first we are crush just with these regular tools and I think the area is quite large and that coal or carbon will just like pour out So I made this This is much smaller diameter so more pressure and I have this like hole which is going to hold the coal in one place and it cannot escape so, if this ain't making some diamonds then you need something else than hydraulic press Yeah, but lets start with this Yeah, lets have a look at those diamonds there should be some around here What the f**k this is a really fine dust and I think this is got to make so terrible mess it's, really, really fine dust there is some like shiny parts, but I think they are so there seems to be some most of it is like a matte black so no diamonds here but there's also some like shiny parts but I think they look more like carbon fibre type of s**t than diamonds so, I think we failed with this try So lets clean this away and get the Diamond Maker 5,000,000 tool ready and try again So that didn't work but this is only 65mm in diameter and I did some math and there's almost 5000 bars in that pot which is like, s**t load so I put my diamond coals there like that and then we are going to just, crush them. at full power and lets see what we have got diamond smoke, don't breath that and now is the most exciting part ever just that fine powder it's really fine now even, like more fine than last time. I can see there is some really small like shiny parts but I'm quite sure that they are not diamonds Yeah, but if I remember correctly from like elementary school there is also really hot under ground where the diamonds form so we are going to try one more time same thing as now but I am going to heat up the coal before crushing so then we have the heat and pressure so lets try with that so I am going to put not so much so we can heat up them bit easier maybe that amount of coal is good and then the most important tool of every YouTuber Gas torch Yeah, there is still pressure on I am going to let it stay for a while like this so the diamonds have some time to form So now is the moment of truth it's time to check if this work more smoke than the last time Yeah looks pretty similar only difference that the powder is hot it's really hot actually check that smoke yeah I don't see any diamonds if there is anything they're really small so, I think this won't work We didn't make diamonds but lets see if the coal powder plus gas torch plus how the basic accident will make dust explosion No we just made our yard black yeah I think that is all for today thank you for watching, and have a nice day. And for todays extra content we have this chicken, unless it's a hen but I think it's extremely dangerous chicken and we have to deal with it so I'm going to put it here I think this is going to be great",Hobbies and Crafts,Collecting,Build a Welcoming Coal Fire,True,3083,en,en

pvU-Cop-rkQ,Cold Remedy Tea with Turmeric Ginger Honey Citrus | HONEYSUCKLE,"As the weather turns colder I am more prone to getting sick with a bad cold or flu. So I often make this Honey Citron Turmeric Tea to help me feel better. It tastes so much better than the drugstore cough syrup and it really works! I’ll explain how but in the meantime be sure to follow me on Snapchat at HoneysuckleBee and on instagram at HoneysuckleCatering to follow my behind-the-scenes snaps. I’m using 2 small lemons that i’ll thinly slice and add to a bowl. I’ll be sure to take the seeds out though cause I don’t want any of that in the tea. The citrus in this recipe is loaded with vitamin C, which is known to support the body’s natural defenses. Lemon and its juice is known to decreases the strength of the flu and the cold virus and it also reduces phlegm. Then I’ll take a whole orange and thinly slice it then I’ll add it to my bowl. I’m leaving the rind on because that’s where all the natural oil are and it will really help flavor the tea later. Orange boosts immunity. Next, I have a knob of ginger about 2 inches long that I’ll peel. Then in my mortar and pestle I’ll grind it up and add it into the bowl. The ginger will soothe your scratchy throat after coughing. My next ingredient is slightly unusual but super powerful. I’m adding in 1 tbsp of turmeric. Turmeric is a spice that can be found in most grocery stores but it’s been used in ancient Ayurvedic and Chinese medicines to clear infection and inflammation. Feel free to adjust the turmeric based on your preference. It can be quite strong. Finally i’m adding 1 cup of raw, organic honey. Raw organic honey is minimally processed and contains many nutrients. It’s like liquid gold that helps with that incessant coughing, and it really helps with sleeping. It contains tryptophan so this is great to get some rest! Once i’ve added all the ingredients together, I’ll give it a good mix and store it in a jar. The honey will draw out the liquid from the citrus and it’ll become very syrupy. I first experienced homemade healing tea when I was really sick and my mom made me this concoction of lemon, rosemary, and honey. Rosemary has its own medicinal properties for coughing but I really wanted to use Ginger and Turmeric so I came up with this recipe. Whenever I’m not feeling well I’ll take a heaping tablespoon of this tea mixture and add it into a cup of hot water. Not only does it taste great, I can feel the honey coating my throat making me feel better. Have you guys tried a homemade remedy tea like this? How has it worked for you?

gNL1RN4eRR8,The Kugelblitz: A Black Hole Made From Light,"Do you think you could you make a black hole out of light? That might sound like a trick question, or like something straight out of the “showerthoughts” subreddit. But physicists say that it should be possible to create a black hole out of nothing but light -- called a kugelblitz, after the German word for “ball lightning.” Even though they have no idea what would actually happen if you tried to do it. Before we talk about that though, let’s talk about the more standard black holes. Usually, a black hole forms when a lot of matter is packed into very little space, which increases its density. If the matter is dense enough, the gravity at its surface becomes so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape its clutches. So to make the Earth into a black hole, you would have to compress its 6 trillion trillion kilograms of rock and water and metal down into a sphere with a diameter of just 16 millimeters. That’s how dense I’m talking about. But we’re just getting started here. Einstein taught us that E=mc^2. In other words, that the energy stored in a bit of matter is equal to its mass times the speed of light squared. This means that there are huge amounts of energy in tiny bits of matter, like atoms -- which is the basic idea behind nuclear power and nuclear weapons. It also means that energy can sometimes act like matter. Now, light doesn’t have any mass, but it does have energy. And, thanks to E=mc^2, gravity can’t tell the difference between energy and matter -- and pulls on them both. And this raises an interesting possibility. All it takes to make a black hole is to pack a bunch of matter in one place, and gravity treats light just like it treats matter. So you could theoretically make a black hole out of nothing but light -- a kugelblitz. Creating a kugelblitz would take a really, really incredible amount of light, though -- because now we’re working with Einstein’s famous equation in the opposite direction. Before, we had a tiny amount of matter producing a huge amount of energy. Now, we have to supply a ton of energy -- in the form of light -- for it to act like tiny bits of matter. So let’s go back to that hypothetical black hole with the mass of the Earth. If we wanted to make that same black hole out of light, how much light would would we need? All of the lights on Earth? All of the sunlight that hits the Earth in a day? In a year? What about all of the sunlight put out by the Sun over the course of an entire year? Not even close. To get an Earth-mass kugelblitz, we would need all of the light put out over 10 years by all of the stars within 350 light-years of Earth – all squished into a bit of space the size of a mosquito. Okay, that’s a lot of light. But what if we wanted to make a black hole that was way, way smaller? Like, I don’t know... the mass of a big cruise ship, like the Titanic ... about 50 million kilograms? To make a kugelblitz that small, you’d need to squeeze all of the sunlight that hit Earth last year into a volume 8,000 times smaller than a proton. It’s hard to even imagine how so much light could get shoved into one place -- or any sort of technology that could accomplish even a fraction of that in the foreseeable future. But even if it could happen, there’s another problem: Making a kugelblitz means that you have to pump so much light-energy into such a tiny region of space that it would get really hot, since heat is just a form of energy. Like, hotter than the universe was a hundredth of a millionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang. And at that extreme temperature, physics as we know it just sort of stops working: space turns soupy, gravity is nonsense, and we have no idea how to describe anything. So if space gets that hot, gravity might go haywire and not be able to form black holes at all any more. Or maybe gravity would get super strong and form a black hole with a million times less energy than we think it should take right now. We just don’t know, we might never know. For now, it seems like kugelblitzes might be theoretically possible, based on Einstein’s basic equations relating energy and mass. It’s a cool idea: using lots of highly focused light to create a black hole, something that even light can’t escape from. But we have no idea how we -- or the universe -- would make one, or even if there’s some undiscovered law of nature that forbids it from existing.

Mik1r5QlfLc,HOW TO PLANT YOUR OWN ORGANIC PARSLEY - INDOOR HERB BOX FOR COOKING/KITCHEN/WINDOW/BALCONY/URBAN,"Hello this is Carl the landscape guy. Today I would like to show you how to plant your own parsley. For this I have this 80cm long flower box with an irrigation system and water level indicator. The dual floor is equipped with felt strips, which provide water to the soil by capillary effect. I insert the floor, taking care that the felt strips hang as evenly as possible to the bottom of the box so that the system works. The water level indicator is placed in the corner and should later ensure that the soil does not become too wet or too dry. I have two different seeds and will try both. First, a standard parsley seed and on the other side the so-called seed pills which are seeds that are pressed into pills. The standard seeds costs about $1, the more expensive pill seeds are approximately $3. Of course, soil is needed before sowing. I use peat-free flower soil and mix it with compost to obtain a loose nutrient-rich soil structure. You can use disposable or garden gloves and it’s best to put the soil into the pot by hand. First I lay the compost, which will later provide good water storage. Then the flower soil on top, because the higher mineral content is good for the young plants. It also helps to crush any soil clumps. I will now sow one side with the standard seeds and the other with the pilled seeds. To do this, I first distribute the standard seeds evenly on the left side and work it lightly into the soil. The seed pills are also distributed evenly and pressed in somewhat. I am already curious which seeds will grow better. Now, of course, watering is very important. I place the finished box in a bright spot on the window sill. After ten days you can clearly see the delicate sprouts. The small plants need constant water supply and light. It can be seen that the standard seeds are already mostly germinated and the seed pills do not show any changes yet. 6 days later a clear growth of the plants can be seen. Unfortunately, the seed pills only germinated sporadically. Therefore, I sow the bare side with new seeds. After about 1 month, the parsley box looks like this. It sits in the kitchen and can be harvested as needed. It doesn't get any healthier than this. And there's no need to go to the grocery store for fresh herbs. If you would like a herb box like this, just make yourself one, it's simple and practical. However, I cannot recommend to use the seed pills. I hope you enjoyed my video, and take a look at my channel. Thank you for watching and until next time I'm Carl the landscape guy.",Home and Garden,Gardening,Make a Plantable Felt Garden Box,True,2536,en,en
A5p1-05NzYc,Holiday Unboxing: Craft & Knit Kits,"Hi, Guys, I'm Kristen and welcome to Studio Knit! The holidays are here which means gift giving season is here. I recently purchased three gift sets for children that I wanted to share with you. I thought they were really good introductions to crafting, to knitting, yarn, looming. I thought that they would provide really good inspiration for you not only to see if you're interested in purchasing these yourself. This is NOT sponsored, I went out to the stores and bought them with my own money. But what they could serve for you is inspiration because we can totally put our own little crafting kits together for gifts. And so I thought these three had some really interesting ideas and maybe this will inspire you to put together some of your own craft kits. So I have three different gift sets that I'd like to share with you. The first one here is paper bag craft kit and this is for ages 4 and above. And it says that you create your own forest friend puppet. This was purchased for $19.99 here in San Francisco we have the Golden Gate National Parks Association and they have areas where they have gift shops and that's where we got this. So a couple of things about this one is that especially because of the paper that's included it has a real like higher designerly look to it. But it's still totally appropriate for kids. And, this is something that I can see that as soon as you take it out of the box you can sit down open all the items and actually immediately create something. I love that it provides everything that you need but you also can let your imagination run wild and get really creative with it as well. In one sitting create something really really cute that you'd be proud of. Moving on, we have the yarn animals. I will have links to where to purchase these kits down below but again, please while you're watching this, I think this will really serve as inspiration to create your own craft kits as gifts and you know what? Bonus! If you have any yarn or craft supplies that you just haven't gotten around to using, you can regift them into a craft kit for a young child and feel really good about it. So, anyway, let's look at the yarn animals. So cute. Packaging on this is amazing. These are magnets right here as you open it up and then you have all of your craft items on one side and then a book which is a really extensive book. On different yarn animals. So, what it says on the cover here is includes spool kit and pom pom tools, over 40 projects to learn, and everything you need to make these four adorable critters. However, you can make these four adorable critters, or which you have all of the supplies here. But there are so many really cute other little critters that you can make, as well. So, I think what they're saying is that they've given you everything that you need to make at least four. And really all you need is to get some more yarn, maybe some more googly eyes, maybe some little like styrofoam balls and some felt if you want to continue on. But, this book is definitely worth the price of the whole kit in and of itself I feel. So, this at Costco was $14.99. This was also for ages 4 and above. And I feel like this would be a really influential gift for a child that is interested in yarn arts and knitting as a way to like sort of get them started, ease them into it. Get them really inspired. And have them really grow as they create new fanciful characters. And last is the Darn Yarn Super Set. Again, this was also purchased at Costco and this was $19.99. I'll have the links where you can purchase it elsewhere below. And this has a whole lot going on. So this is an awesome gift to have under the Christmas Tree, as a really fun gift to open and definitely has some really great starter materials in it. Instructions. You know, I would say, a little Marketing Advice to the company is that there's a little bit of diversity on the cover, but what's missing? There are no boys. And it would actually benefit them to include this not being just for girls but for all children. As we know, yarn arts is not only for girls and women, and there are a lot of boys and some very manly men who are amazing knitters. So, that's just a little advice from me. So, I hope you had fun seeing me unboxing these yarn-y, crafty gift sets with me. I hope you all have a wonderful holiday. Here on my channel on Studio Knit I have some really fun holiday themed projects coming up some tips and tricks. I also have a holiday collaboration with my friends at Kin Community and just so much wonderful, festive holiday cheer coming your way. So, if you haven't already, please make sure to like this video and subscribe and I'll see you next time. Bye!",Hobbies and Crafts,Crafts,Create a Craft Kit as a Gift,True,4701,en,en
IUJCkBRUKrY,Turning a Comfort Ring Core (Woodturning Project),"Hi I'm Mike with Craft Supplies USA and today we're going to show you how to make a custom turned ring. Almost everyone owns a ring, but seeing one made from wood is a rarity that gets a lot of attention and they've been a big hit with the team here at Craft Supplies USA. Today we're going to turn a ring using the Artisan Comfort Fit Ring Core. These ring cores are made from highly polished solid stainless steel that won't tarnish or stain and the interior edges have a rounded profile, making them very comfortable to wear. There are a full range of sizes and widths available to suit everyone's taste. We're going to turn an 8mm wide ring for this project, but first I need to take a blank that's a 1/16"" wider than our ring. Blank selection is very important for this project. As you can see there is very little material here, so wood movement must be kept to an absolute minimum or it could crack in half. The blank needs to be very dry, or better yet a stabilized blank. stabilized blanks have resin drawn in through the pores, making them impervious to wood movement, which is perfect for rings. And dense tight-grained exotics work well too. I've selected a stabilized Padauk blank and now I need to prepare it for turning. It will be mounted to a waste block using double-sided tape, but first we need a flat reference face. Lay some 120 grit sandpaper on a flat surface and sand one side flat. Once it's flat, apply double-sided tape to the reference face then flip it over and mark the center of the blank. At the lathe, mount a waste block and true up the face using a skew. This will be our jig for drilling and rough turning the blank for the ring core. Peel off the tape backing and line up the center mark with a revolving Center and use the tailstock to apply firm pressure, so the tape on securely to the waste block. With the tailstock in place, rough turn the blank to round. Select a drill bit that is approximately half the diameter of the ring core to make a pilot hole. Mount the bit in a drill chuck and drill completely through the blank. This next step is the most critical, so make sure you take your time. Using a narrow scraper or skew, laid flat on it's side, open up the drilled hole until the ring core fits snugly. Stop and test the fit frequently to prevent an oversized hole. I keep a few different ring cores on hand just in case I make the hole too big. In that case I'll simply go up to the next size. Once the fit is right, press the ring core into the hole until it seats flat against the waste block. Now true up the side of the blank and turn it down until it's just a hair wider than the ring core. Be careful not to scratch the ring core with the tool. If you do scratch it, you can usually buff it out with the white diamond compound on a buffing wheel. Next, carefully peel the blank off the waste block using a putty knife. I like to leave the ring core in during this process to help support the blank. Use slow steady pressure so the blank doesn't break. Now we're ready to glue the ring core into the blank. First, lightly scuff the outside of the ring core with 220 grit sandpaper for a better bond. Lightly coat the inside of the blank with epoxy or CA glue. This gives the wood a chance to absorb some glue before the ring core scrapes the excess away. Insert the ring core until it's flush with the edges. And make sure to wipe away any excess glue and let it cure. You can lay wax paper on a flat surface to make this easier. Don't worry if you didn't get all the glue off the ring. It easily scrapes off the stainless steel using your fingernails There are three different sizes of Delrin bushings available, depending on the size of ring you're making. The bushings are made out of Delrin, so they won't scratch the ring core and glue won't stick to them when applying a CA finish. After the glue is cured, mount the ring between the Delrin ring bushings on a pen mandrel. I made a spacer to move the bushings a little farther away from the headstock and I've also got a Precision Machine Pen Center on the tailstock end. You can also stack up any pen bushings you have on hand to accomplish the same thing. Now we're ready to turn the blank to shape. The blank is very delicate, so take light cuts. I like to use a negative rake scraper when turning rings because it's not aggressive and easy to control. Once it's turned to shape, sand the blank through 320 grit or higher. There are a lot of options for finishes, but we recommend a CA finish because it's durable, resistant to moisture and it builds to a very high gloss. And it's jewelry, so it's supposed to be shiny. I'll apply at least ten coats of CA for rings. You can buff the finish for an even higher gloss if desired. We'll that wraps up this project, I hope you enjoyed learned how to turn a wooden ring. It's a fun project that's a real eye-catcher. If you liked the video, subscribe to our channel and give it a thumbs up.

Pn4Z69BjvRc,Secrets to Planting Basil at Home  (Complete Guide),"Welcome green thumbs. Today we are going to review planting basil. Basil is one of the most popular herbs we love to enjoy all season long. There are many types of different basils available. Jessica is planting Genovese a sweet basil. Tools: The items you will require are: Cooking tray, gloves, hand trowel, Chop stick, Watering can, Small pot, potting mix soil We recommend buying a started batch of basil seedlings. They will come in a small pot and can likely be found in your grocery store or local garden store. It is not common knowledge that in that small pot there are so many separate basil plants. The basil plants will do much better if separated. Jessica is going to show us how to turn our little pot of sweet smelling basil into a cornucopia of basil. Basil is commonly grown from seed in a greenhouse. Each of these stems has grown from a seed and therefore is its own plant. Jessica will first prepare the pot for planting. It is very important that you make sure your pot has good drainage as basil needs very well draining soil to flourish. We can now fill the pot with soil from the bag of container soil and in many areas you can purchase soil specifically produced for herbs such as our basil. Fill the pot to 1.5 to 2 inches from the top. You can then use both hands on each side of the pot lightly tap the pot on the table 5 or 6 times to compress the soil. You can then add more soil if required to get to our desired depth. Now use your hands to even out the soil and gently press on the top to level and make ideal for planting. Once the pot is full of soil and ready to go you can set it aside and we can work on separating our basil plants. Gentle turn the pot on its side in both hands and wiggle off the pot setting it aside. Take hold of the soil root ball and gently separate it in the middle. You can then start to gently separate each of the plants. They may break away in small groups from there they can each be slowly worked apart trying to keep as much of the roots as possible. It is amazing to think that our $1.99 plant we bought actually has 23 separate plants in it. Now depending on the size of your pot you can now decide how may plants will fit in. For Jessica’s new pot she has room for 10 basils. We can now choose our healthiest 10 plants, which we will use for planting in our new pot. It is possible to find some of the plants are damaged or suffering from root rot which if left can affect the other plants. They can now be discarded and the healthiest survive. Jessica will now start planting. Using her hand trowel, she will make sure to get the depth of the seedling roots as deep as they are in the soil. Make the next hole in the soil 2 inches from the last hole and in line. Jessica now has all 10 of her basil seedlings replanted. She will now make sure to snug in all the roots and bases of each plant, straightening the stems and gently compressing the soil around the edge of the inside of the pot. Once the planting is done it is essential that we do a thorough watering. Using the watering can, slowly pour and allow it to soak in. You can make sure that the water is running out the bottom. Using the chopstick now you can again gently firm the plants into the wet soil and help them to stand straight. We do not want to let the pot sit in a water filled tray so ideally switch out the tray or drain, dry and reuse the current tray. From here you can place your basil pot in a sunny window silltim or in Jessica’s case under a single grow light situated in the pantry area. From here the basil will require watering every 3 days and the light should be turned off during the evening hours. And look at the bounty that our simple pot of Basil has turned into.",Home and Garden,Gardening,Germinate and Care for Basil Seedlings,True,3725,en,en
-nvUuHKkLgk,How To Use CONTENT-AWARE SCALE in Photoshop - ADVANCED Methods,"Welcome back to another very exciting tutorial here at the PhotoshopTrainingChannel.com. My name is Jesus Ramirez and you can find me on Instagram @JRfromPTC. In this video, you will learn how to use Photoshop’s Content-Aware Scale. This video is going to be part of my Content-Aware series on my YouTube channel. I already have several other videos on how to use the Content-Aware technology. They’re grouped together in a YouTube playlist. There’s a link to it down below in the description. But anyway, in this video we’re going to focus solely on the Content-Aware Scale which allows you to resize an image without changing important visual content such as people, buildings, and other important items in the image. Normal scaling affects all pixels uniformly, while Content-Aware Scale affects mostly pixels in areas that don’t have important visual content. In this tutorial, I’m going to show you two examples of how to use the Content-Aware Scale. We’ll use a photograph, and I’ll also show you one of the techniques that I use when creating screenshots of user interfaces. Okay, let’s get started. So we’re going to work with this image of the Sydney harbour. So we have the Sydney Opera House. And if you notice, this image is quite wide. It is actually wider than the canvas, as you can see there. And sometimes you maybe working with images that you may need to fit in a required space. It maybe a constriction based on the blog post that you’re creating. Maybe it’s a social media profile or it could even be a magazine layout or anything of the sort. The point is, is that you’re trying to fit an image into a predefined area or aspect ratio. In this case, these layers are way too wide for the space that we have. You can, of course, press Ctrl T/ Command T to transform and scale the image in. But if you do that you will of course, stretch the pixels and you will distort buildings. I’m going to press the escape key to cancel that and, obviously, that is not the best way to do it. But in Photoshop we can use the Content-Aware Scale to help us with this problem. So I’m going to go into Edit-Content-Aware Scale or you can use the keyboard shortcut Alt+ Shift+ Ctrl C, that’s Option + Shift/Command C on the Mac. And watch what happens when I scale now. I’m going to click and drag from the left, and notice how I’m not really distorting the image. Instead, Photoshop is collapsing the pixels that don’t have important content. So we did not distort the Sydney Opera House or a lot of the buildings here on the left hand side. When you’re done, you can just press the check mark. And now this image fits then the predefined space. I’m going to press Ctrl+ Alt+ Z/ Command Option Z on the Mac to undo. And I’m going to show you a couple of the features that this tool has. So I’m going to go back into Edit- Content-Aware Scale and notice the Options bar, we got a few options. First, on the left-hand side, we have the reference point. Notice currently that middle box is selected, that means that the reference point is right in the center. That’s default. This is where the image is going to scale from once we start clicking and dragging on the handles. I can click on these boxes and notice that the point moves. Now the point is here, in the center on the right. And I can scale and it’s scaling from that point. Another important setting in the Options bar is the Amount, currently it’s set to 100 and that should be default. This is the ratio between Content-Aware Scale in regular scale. At 100% you’re doing all Content-Aware Scale but if I bring that back to 0, notice how the image will change. It reverts back to regular scaling. And, of course, 49% will be about 50-50. So you’re doing half regular scale, half Content-Aware. In most cases though, a 100% Content-Aware Scale is what you need. You can also protect skin tones by clicking on this icon here. We don’t have any skin tones in this image so we don’t need to worry about. But if you’re working with a portrait, you may want to click on this icon to protect the person in the portrait. There’s also this Protect dropdown menu and it allows you to protect pixels in the image. And I’m going to show you how that works. I’m just going to tap on this cancel button to cancel that Content-Aware and I’m just going to move this over to the right and I’m going to show you how to protect the pixels on the left-hand side here. So, what you need to do is make the selection using the Lasso tool – it doesn’t have to be very precise - around the areas that you want to protect. Also notice that I have a Feather of almost 10 pixels, that’s okay. That just means that it’s not going to be a sharp selection. There’s going to be some blurriness to it. Then I’m going to go into the Channels panel, create a New Channel and fill it with white Alpha 1. White is my background color. I can press Ctrl + Backspace/Command Backspace on the Mac. So now anything that is white will be protected and anything that is black can be adjusted with the Content-Aware Scale. I’m going to press Ctrl D/ Command D to deselect. Click on RGB and go back into my Layers panel. And if I go into Edit-Content-Aware Scale, under Protect, choose Alpha 1 because that’s the name of the channel that we created. We can scale that in and notice how the pixels in the white will be protected. Notice how none of those pixels are changing, then you can click on the check mark and the scale is complete. Now I’m going to show you how I use this feature for something completely different. Some of you may know I do writing for magazines and blogs regarding Photoshop, of course. And when writing these articles I often have to take screenshots of the user interface and those screenshots need to fit within specific spaces. So, I have this screenshot of the Layers panel in Photoshop and this white space will represent the area that needs to fit in. So usually what I would do in the past would be to figure out the space that I needed, so now I know it’s that space there and, obviously, it’s too tall. So I would make a selection, hit the delete key, make a selection again and move that up and try to fit it within that space. As you see, this is very time consuming and it’s not very efficient. I’m going to press Ctrl+ Alt Z/ Command Option Z on the Mac to undo. But we can take advantage of that same Content-Aware technology and use it to solve this problem. So what you can do is take your new eye element, figure out how big it needs to be and then go to Edit-Content-Aware Scale and you can scale that in and notice how Photoshop knew exactly what pixels were irrelevant and it kept all the pixels that contain the detail. So this is a technique that I use that helps me speed up the process of creating screenshots for the articles that I write. Let me know if you come up with any other interesting ways of using the Content-Aware Scale. Leave a comment down below. Don’t forget to watch the other videos in this Content-Aware series on my YouTube channel. Once again, the link to the playlist is right below in the description.

f4ue1bTPL5M,America's Got Talent Finals YOUNG MAGICIAN GETS HEIDI & MEL B TO KISS | Collins Key,"- Did you feel that? - Yeah. - Check it out. - Oh my world. (laughs) - To me close-up magic is purely skill. You put hours and years of your life into learning one move, and then when you do that move, you don't want anyone to see it. In the first auditions I did close-up magic. - Wow. - Come on everybody make some noise! - [Collins] But you can't do the same magic trick twice, but what I can do tonight is, go back to my roots. Close-up magic, and give people an experience that will be very intimate. And very magical. (mysterious music) (cheering) - Alright, now in my first audition, I did close-up magic for you guys at your table. So tonight, I thought I'd bring it full circle. And do some close-up magic. So Mel B, we're gonna start off taking cards like this, and you just say the word stop. - Stop. - Okay, gotta marker, what I want you to do is take this marker and I want you to sign this card. Perfect, alright, great, let's actually, this needs to dry off a little bit, hold on. (blowing) Okay, actually, we'll give it a second to dry. So then, Heidi, we're gonna do pretty much the same thing, alright? What I'd like you to do, say the word stop, whenever you want. - Stop. - Right here, this will be your card. Take the sharpie, sign it. Great, we've got Heidi, your card and Mel B, your card alright each of you guys signed one. Now this is where it begins to get crazy. If we take the cards, just push them slowly together like this, the edges will actually line up, that didn't work. Hold on, sorry, this is the most technical part, you need to get the edges to actually line up, just like that. See how the edges line up? Gotta keep the cards together. Heidi, I want you to bite down on this end of the card, it's for the trick I promise. Alright Mel B, bite down on this end. Over here. (cheering) (laughing) Alright now, ladies, ladies, put your lips together on the card. - Whoa! - Now what's gonna actually happen, your gonna start to actually feel the card heat up, I can sense like the tension right here. The card actually starts to heat up. - Can I ask Heidi something? - Yeah, I don't know is she can talk right now. - Whoa. - Oh. - Whoa. (cheering) - Alright. - Okay what's gonna happen these two cards are gonna heat up and start to melt together. You're actually gonna feel the cards start to melt right now, they've melted. (laughs) Let me take the card for a second. I can see the bite imprints, look at this. - I know. - Oh. - Actually, you can see it's one card, here, I want you to feel it, they're not like glued together or stuck together. It really is one card. - No. - This is where it gets crazy. - There's only one card we had two cards. Shut up. - If you're wondering where the next one went. - Oh my God. - Check it out, the one card is actually infused into the back. - Shut up! - Oh my god! - I didn't feel anything! - Here I want you to take the card, just pull it and just go through it it's really legit-ly there, right? You can see the same thing Mel B. - Yes! - Actually here let me see the card for a second. (rips) Here we go, you can each keep a half. Thank you. - Wow. - Thank you Heidi. - Wow. - What a twist, on a card trick. Collins Key ladies and gentlemen. Bringing some real excitement to the judges table, forget seeing Howie and Howard kiss that was a moment. (laughs) Heidi, you still seem mesmerized. (laughs) - I mean when it's this close, especially, you know my eyes were like full on focusing, I mean, first of all why didn't you not have the boys do this. You know how much they like to. (kissing noises) (laughs) It could have been another moment, you know. - I'm up for it, let's go. - Wow, I'm shocked, I don't know how you do it. - Thank you so much, thank you. - Good job. (laughs) - Wow. - Howard. - You're a terrific performer, 17 years old, let's remind America of that. (cheering) And I think you've got a great future. - Thank you so much. - I though this was pretty awesome. - Mel B. - Collins, I actually think that that was one of your best performances. You listened to Howard you sped everything up, it all made sense. I nearly got to kiss Heidi, thank you very much for that, I thought that was great! And I do hope people vote for you 'cause you're young and inspirational.

ysNKDoSSl-Y,"How to Silk Screen Print a t-shirt with a Paper Stencil, Rubilith film, or hand painted films.","well hello again today I want to talk about something that's near and dear to my heart, that's right I want to talk about film positives. The film positive seems to be the biggest barrier keeping people like yourself from getting into screen printing at home ah well all. In today's video tutorial I'm going to show you four different ways to make a film positive without any expensive equipment let's get started stop shaking stop shaking number one have them printed by a professional service I've included a link in the description below number two and cust nsel's if you have some free hand or tracing skills this is a great do-it-yourself option or if you're lazy like me you could just print it out grab yourself a blade and cut out the black areas to create a stencil solid graphics and text are the best way to go with this method now you're going to lay the stencil over the flat side of the screen reading backwards and tape it to the mesh flip the screen over and tape the remaining open areas of mesh create a damn with tape around the inside edge this makes clean up later a hell of a lot easier now eat the screen load a shirt and do a print the stencil after the first print sticks to the mesh allowing you to do multiple prints with the paper stencil throw the frame with your heat gun and move on to the next method number three handpainted films this method works surprisingly well grab a paintbrush just some hobbyist acrylic paint and a blank transparent film lick your thumb and index finger and pinch the film paint on the side that sticks to your finger if you got the skills you can go all the best get out on the film if however you like me and you'd rather trace some shit then do it up tape the printout to your desk and then take the film positive over the printout bust out that black paint and start tracing the idea here is to build up a completely black out image and this method will allow you to get much greater detail than the paper stencil message now that you got that fucker painted let it dry and you can use it just like any other film positive that's Method number three let's move on to method for and last but certainly not least is number four hand cut ruby lift this is just a warning this stuff has become rare as shit none of my local suppliers had it I had to actually resort to ebay to get my hands on this stuff so I ordered them saddle my ass and finally two weeks later the UPS guy showed up not the most convenient solution but I'm showing you how to do it anyway I'm gonna print out your graphic just like we did on the hand-painted film tape it to a cutting board just like this you have to make sure with rouble if that you are cutting the correct side so you have a clear carrier sheet and then you have the red ruby lips film you want to make sure that the carrier sheet is facing down on the graphic and that the red film is facing up place it over the printout and babe it down now you're going to grab your exacto knife and start stenciling the image out Wow the red film acts as a UV blocker removing the red film from the carrier allows the UV light to harden the emulsion beneath it there's a great many benefits to rubra with the main two are the fact that after you've put in the labor you can hang on to these films forever second main thing is that you can do really find details if you have the steady hand and the patient's there's also the added bonus of it being punk rock as fuck so I've officially given you four different ways to create film positives without any expensive equipment you're welcome to thank me for all my hard work punch the thumbs up subscribe to the channel and share this bad boy with your friends I'm cam with monument limited remember to think of us for all of your professional screen printing needs one of those gots to be you",Hobbies and Crafts,Crafts,Stencil a T Shirt,True,3826,en,en

K6lhy-Ad-yc,Ceramic and Porcelain Repair | 1-2-Fixed with Tech-Bond,"Welcome to Tech-Bond Molecular Bonding Systems 1-2-fixed video on how to repair ceramics and porcelain. We have here a family heirloom whose leg has been broken off so to fix this we are. So going to start with our structural adhesive, SI blue. We're going to apply this to one edge. Remember less is more and you can use the nozzle to spread it evenly around. Now with porcelain and ceramics, you're going to take your broken piece and you'll be able to feel it click into place. We're then going to take our activator accelerator and apply a little bit of pressure to our broken piece and spray it right on the seam. Once we have applied the accelerator, we are now done. We have a food-safe, coffee safe, microwave safe, and dishwasher safe peace. Yes, your repair will be that easy. You may be asking yourself how does it work so easily and why does it work so well? The short answer chemistry. When used properly, our activator accelerator actually intensifies the chemical reaction that occurs when used with one of our SI structural adhesives. That stronger chemical reaction means a stronger bond, a more durable bond, a bond that is easily executed, and an all around better repair. In addition to the 1-2-Fixed instructional videos on how to complete your repairs, you can also find a step-by-step instruction guide that coincides with each video.

_TNSUIsjdpY,"HOLDING AN EXPLOSION at 20,000 fps - Smarter Every Day 156","Hey, it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day (SED). So excited about this video In the last episode of SED I showed you my transparent potato gun, at 3,000 fps during the day. 3, 2, 1 But this episode it's going to be the same transparent potato gun, meaning we can look directly into the science at night, at 20,000 fps. Google up! Science is about to happen. What happens, if I start the ignition of the potato gun from the back? vs. What happens, if I start it from the middle? I always thought it would have worked better if you go from the middle, 'cause you get even expansion of those gases. But, let's record it in high-speed, and let's see what the difference is, between the two. We'll go from the back first! We got some potato juices in there. 3, 2, 1 (laughter) It's like 9 o'clock. Alright, let's see it in high-speed. It's completely awesome. We saw that it started at one end and went all the way to the end. Now, I'm gonna take this, it's a grill-ignitor, You can see the little zaps there. I've got electrodes, set up in the center of the potato gun and we're going to zap it from the center and we should get a more even combustion, right? So, let me hook it up and then we'll give it a shot. literally. Loading the potato gun again. 3, 2, 1 (laughter) It doesn't get old! Was that cool, or what? Ok, so check it out, so this is my combustion chamber, right? The first time I shot this thing, it was a flint-sparker on the end of this thing, right? If I hold it, you can see a twist and I get the spark. What you saw on the second time - here are my electrodes that I told you about going to hit this button you can see down in there. Can you see what I'm sparking right there in the middle? That's how I fired that thing. When we first start the combustion from the end it's a wave you've got an oxygen/fuel mixture that goes all the way down to the combustion chamber; when we start right in the middle, we start to expand, we start using that fuel and using that oxygen, but we run out of oxygen before we burn all the fuel. We're going to shoot this thing from the end, we're going to zoom in with a high-speed directly on the combustion chamber and we're gonna see if we can see that flame front moving one Mississippi two Mississippi three Mississippi four Mississippi three two one Ok, before i show you the next slow mo, I want you to understand that it has enough information in it to provide for several phd's ,so I want you to be on the lookout for a couple of key things that I find interesting. #1 When the explosion moves towards the closed off into the combustion chamber, unless the fuel/air mixture is just perfect, sometimes you'll run out of oxygen and have unburned fuel this creates a compressed pocket of fuel, that stays unburned until it turns into a rarefaction and pulls more oxygen back in through the barrel, to burn it up #2 There's something that happens in combustion chambers called ""sidewall cooling"" basically the pipe itself cools the gases down below the combustion point, so it can't burn right next to the wall this leaves more unburned fuel and actually counts for most of the pollution products caused by the engine in your car The slow-motion you're about to see is real. I haven't ran the speed, to make it look more interesting, It's just pure awesome footage. Straight out of a high-speed cameras. Watch what happens, as the explosion over expands, the system has to equalize so it pulls air back in through the barrel ,into the combustion chamber, which causes that fresh oxygen in the air to meet up with the remaining fuel and start the burning process all over again. It's a pretty inefficient way to burn a fuel rich mixture; so I think my original hypothesis might be wrong. I think it's cool that when the gas squeezes down into the barrel from the combustion chamber, it has to speed up so that it can maintain the exact same flow rate One of the things I love about science, is the ability to look at a complex dynamic system like this and try to understand every physical phenomenon that's occurring, but equally important to me personally is the ability to look at footage like this and say ""you know, that's pretty."" To summarize, what we've learned tonight, think about this: when you have a combustion chamber we've learned that it depends not only on the localized chemistry or the stoichiometry, the fuel/air mixture at any point inside that combustion chamber; it also depends on how its vented it's really fascinating the dynamics of venting a combustion chamber effect directly the ability to create localized pressures and rarefactions sometimes at the end of the video when the add part comes up you kind of roll your eyes ,because you're not excited about it. Well, this time is different, you see, SED is supported by audible.com and they have supported me for a really long time and it's a really big deal because it's kind of expensive to afford videos like this. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to create an audible event so that you can remember to support SED at audible.com/smarter. We're going to create the same flame front that we did before, only we're not going to contain both sides of it we're going to vent one side I want you to listen to this huge audible vent and then we'll look at high speed ready? 3, 2, 1... It's on fire! If you want to support SED, feel free to go to audible.com/smarter. That's a very audible event, I hope you agree, anyway they have tons of free audio books.If you get a free trial at audible.com/smarter I'm super stoked that they have chosen to support smarter every day for so long they've been a very valuable partner and I am very appreciative so if you want to support SED directly go to audible.com/smarter get a free trial of audiobooks you're going to get smarter and you're going to like it.

g224A2cMORI,Potato vs Watermelon - Smarter Every Day 155,"Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day. I have built a potato gun out of clear pipe which is amazing because you can see what's going on on the inside of the potato gun. Today's experiment is going to be pretty fun. Please excuse my scratchy voice but this is my only day off of work. This is my buddy. What are you going to do to help me? Uhmm, I'm going to trigger the high speed camera. Destin: Trigger the high speed camera. That's right. This is the high speed camera we are going to use to film at about 3000 fps. This is going to be a pretty big explosion so you are going to need that. We've got our potato ammunition, isobutane propellant (hairspray), watermelon and large squash. We're going to put a squash up here and we are going to hit it with a potato and see how much force we can transfer to that thing. You ready? Should be fun, let's give it a shot. Okay so the important thing when are putting a potato in a potato gun is you want a seal all the way around the potato. There is a fancy word for that. It is called obturation. If you can get a complete obturation seal on the obturator you can get more compression and more velocity. So let's see how many Mississippi's we are going to put in here... 3, 2, 1 Alright let's see. Let's see if it worked. Broke just a little bit but we can do better than that can't we? Alright let's do it again! Okay that white part all the way around that's touching the barrel on the potato that's called the what? Obturator. And what does the obturator do? It makes the air not go past the bullet. Destin: That's right. It makes the explosion not go past the bullet. Ohhh that was a weak one wasn't it? We broke the squash. Destin: Did we? I think gravity did that more than the potato don't you? Let's go look at the high speed but I think the potato is breaking when it hits the squash so we might have to make a stronger potato on the front. Okay the potato is just shattering on impact. So clearly we need to fortify our potato. So I'm going to drill a hole in it here and put some metal on the front and see what that does. 3, 2, 1 I think that worked... Okay so the potato kept breaking, right? So we are going to use this. But it is made in a plastic case, so why can we use this in the barrel? Because it has the obturator. That's right. Good for you that's a big word for a little boy im proud of you. Okay let's go get it set up. You hear that seal? It's really good. It's really hard to do it because it's a really good seal. 3, 2, 1 Are you ready? 3, 2, 1, Go! Okay one quick thing I wanted to point out about the potato gun, it has to do with pressure, volume, and velocity. As the propellant ignites and pressure causes the potato to move down the barrel, when it does this the volume behind the potato expands. As the volume increases, if the burn rate doesn't keep up, sometimes the pressure can start to decrease. Different types of potato gun propellant burn at different rates. Depending on the length of the barrel, if the volume expands to much, the pressure inside the chamber can actually dip below atmospheric pressure. The pressure can dip so low in fact that it can condense water vapor out of the air. I'm not 100% sure that's what is happening in this next clip but it's still awesome. Check it out. That is what you call backyard ballastics. I hope you enjoy this episode of Smarter Everyday. It was brought to you buy Audible.com. Before I tell you about the book I've been listening to I'm going to tell you about the next episode which is ridiculous. It's the same combustion chamber, transparent, at night, in slow motion, but I propagate that flame by initiating it at different points inside the combustion chamber. When I saw the slow-mo I just giggled like a lot. It's really a blast. That was bad, I'm so sorry. Anyway, if you want to see that episode go click that potato right over there. I think you will really enjoy it. Back to the sponsor. Audible.com sponsors Smarter Everyday and this is really easy to sell for me, this is not a challenge because Audible is my happy place. When I get on an airplane my favorite thing to do is to play a game on my phone and listen to an audio book. recently I'm listening to a Hitchhicker's Guide to the Galaxy the Restaurant at the End of the Universe. I really enjoy it. I've done this for years. I've listened to audio books on Audible.com well before they decided to start sponsoring Smarter Everyday. I listen to a bunch of books these are the ones I have physical copies of, whatever. It's you getting smarter. This is what you call a soft sell. I don't have to convince you, you're smart people, you know why going to audible.com/smarter would help Smarter Every Day. You also know that listening to audio books is smart. Anyway, that's it. There is plenty of stuff to click if you are interested in doing that. If you want to go click that potato and go giggle with me, feel free to do that. I'm Destin and you're getting smarter every day. Have a good one. What happen's if I start the ignition of the potato gun from the back? What happens if I start from the middle?

9-hIbb1uh48,Pressure Cooker Swiss Steak ~ How to Make Swiss Steak ~ Instant Pot Recipe ~ Noreen's Kitchen,"Hi everyone welcome back to my kitchen today, we're gonna use our pressure cooker one more time This is going to be a pressure cooker version of my Swiss steak recipe we're gonna make everything in the pressure cooker We're gonna brown off the meat. We're gonna cook it and it's gonna take a little under 45 minutes, and it's gonna be awesome Let's go see how this all comes together Okay, we're gonna go over all the ingredients first for our pressure cooker Swiss steak It's very similar to my Swiss steak that I make in my crock pot That video is almost 8 years old so I think it's probably time to go ahead and Do an update first off. I have some cube steak here I've got a really good sale they were buy one get one free so I got two packages This is just round steak That's been run through a Swiss eMachine and if you didn't know This recipe isn't Swiss the term Swiss steak means that the meat has been run through a cubing machine or a Swiss EMachine and that's why it's called Swiss steak. I'm gonna use some mushrooms, but I didn't have any canned mushrooms in my pantry so I went ahead and I rehydrated some dehydrated mushrooms in some beef stock Which we're also going to be using in this recipe I have a couple of cups of flour Seasoned with my sejun steak seasoning which is right here. I'll leave a link down below to where you can find that 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes 1 medium onion sliced 3 stalks of celery diced and then we're gonna get into these seasonings that I'm using I'm also gonna use a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce 2 tablespoons of Shirley J onion seasoning which is right here, and I love it for beef things or anytime I need a little oniony goodness added This is very similar to onion soup mix And I will make sure I note that in the recipe that you can find on my website There will be a link down below the video you can use an envelope of Regular onion soup mix if you don't have this But if you would like to try this I will leave a link for you to the Shirley J Website where you can get yourself some? We're also gonna be using 1/3 of a cup of Shirley J. Beef slow cooker seasoning You don't have to use this, but this is a really great way to flavor up your Swiss steak We're also gonna be using a cup of ketchup, so what we're gonna do now we're gonna bring the pressure cooker over I'm gonna go ahead and dredge the meat in the seasoned flour and then we're gonna move on and it's gonna be super easy It's gonna take no time at all to do this We're gonna Brown it up a little then we're going to get a little and you're gonna Love it so let me get that done And we'll bring bring you back as soon as we're ready to move on I've been browning off the mistake just a little bit we want to get some color on there and I'm just going to go ahead and do it right in my pressure cooker now. This isn't a lease. It's the 10 quart and If I want to brown, I just have to put it on soup and stew and it's gonna be like sauteing And it'll stay hot for me until I get that task done I've browned off the rest of this and this is what it looks like so as soon as this in here is finished Then we'll move on and we'll start constructing our Swiss steak and it'll take Just a little bit of time and you'll be on your way to dinner our meat is all brown and it's over here But first I just want to get all my veggies in here so in with the onions celery I'm just gonna give these a little quick stir It's also gonna help give some those brown bits up off the bottom those are gonna add great flavor Don't even worry about them, and of course as this cooks those are gonna Come up anyway, and you don't have to saute these. I just want to get them in there They're gonna take up some of that oil, and they're gonna soften just a little bit and start cooking I'm gonna add my mushrooms, which I have drained out of The liquid because I may not need all that liquid Mushrooms are completely optional here. I use them sometimes and sometimes. I don't we're gonna go ahead and add the meat back in See just dump it in And then we'll add all of our liquids let's see Here's our 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes Here's our 1 cup of ketchup And if you guys like pepper steak if you add like a red and a green bell pepper in here Then you'll have some great pepper steak as well. I'm gonna add my slow cooker seasoning my onions seasoning My tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce we don't want to put too much because too much horst assure is like ooh is like too much Cloves you can actually have too much Give this a bit of a stir or actually just kind of judge. It around a little we're gonna need that liquid So I have about three cups of broth here from soaking my mushrooms And we're ready to go it looks fabulous it smells great, and now we're just gonna put it under pressure. You'll want to Consult your owners manual for whatever a particular brand or model of pressure cooker you own I do not have a instant pot and But I do have this elite model, and I also have a power pressure xl6 quart So you'll want everybody every single one is a little bit different So you'll want to make sure you know how to operate yours to the best of your ability so that you have a very favorable outcome I'm going to put mine on meat and chicken and I'm going to pressurize it for 20 minutes and then It'll come up to pressure.

I5xfVyb_p9A,How to Fix Car AC that Blows Hot Air (AC Compressor),"Rev up your engines! [MUSIC PLAYING] It's time for scottykilmer.com. If your car's air conditioning has stopped blowing cold, then stay tuned because today, I'm gonna show you how to fix a broken air conditioner. The first thing to do is open the hood and check the pressure. So get a set of AC gauges and hook them up. But don't worry, they don't cost much. I got these at Harbor Freight Tool for like $50. Then, you get the low pressure fitting, the blue one, and then, look around the air conditioning system to find where the low side pressure fitting is. And there it as. The blue cap's on top of it. You hook the fitting up to it and turn the knob to open it. You can see on the gauge there's zero pressure, so all the refrigerant leaked out. So what fun. Now, we gotta find where the leak is. And to find leaks, I always use ultraviolet leak dye. I inject it into the system. You just hook it up to the add line and turn the handle once, and it injects the dye into the system. Now, if you don't have this device, you can also buy refrigerant cans that have the dye built in, and you just add it in with the refrigerant can. Then, you add some refrigerant to the system so you can get it running and it'll run the dye through to find a leak. Just open the valve, and you can see refrigerant's going in. And now, the compressor's running. Let it suck in the refrigerant for about two minutes or so. And then once the system is running by itself, it run for 10 or 15 minutes to circulate the oil through the system to find where the leak is. Now, not only can I get my ultraviolet light out and look for leaks, but I can hear it hissing. So let's use our ears. I can hear it hissing, and it's the compressor that hissing. It's leaking. But just to make sure, I made some soapy water, and I'll pour it on top of it. And sure enough, when I pour it on top, you can see the bubbles and hear the hissing change sound. So it's time for a new compressor. Now, I've already made a video on how to replace an air conditioner on YouTube, so you can watch that for the whole thing. But basically, you unbolt the lines. Just get a big wrench and take them off. Pull them off. Then, take the four bolts off the compressor and pull it out of the way. And out it comes. Now, when it comes to getting a new compressor, my advice is always buy a brand new one. The rebuilt ones can be very iffy. I can't tell you how many times in the past I used to try to rebuild compressors, then they'd come out and bite me in the rear end, and I'd have to do it all over again. Then, you bolt the new compressor on and hook up the vacuum pump to evacuate the system. You want to evacuate the system for about an hour or hour and a half to suck all the moisture out. Then, fill the system with refrigerant. In this case, it takes 600 grams. So open up the valve, and let it start filling up. And now, we've got nice cold air blowing in the face. So the next time your car's air conditioning stops blowing cold, now you know how to fix it.

sXrpl1JK0NY,"Bruschetta, the Easy Way | Easy Italian w. Cake Boss Lisa Ep01","Hi guys, this is Easy Italian with Lisa Valastro. Today I'm going to show you my go-to recipe for appetizers: bruschetta. So what I'd like to do is usually use some day-old bread, slice up the bread nice and thin. Then I'm gonna line it up right in the pan. Bruschetta is one of those recipes that you could use any ingredients that you like, but today I'm going to show you my version of bruschetta. We are gonna take some olive oil And we're just gonna drizzle it right on top. Now the trick with this, cuz I've burnt a lot of bread in my ovens, is you got a sit and babysit it. So what you do is put your broiler on and put the bread in the oven, and you watch, because it's only gonna take about 30 seconds to a minute, depending on your oven, to brown the top. It looks like these are nice and browned now. What I'm going to do is I'm going to flip them, so we could brown the other side, so they're nice and crispy. Could hear that crunch. That's when you know you browned them just right. So once you flip them off, very carefully place them back in your broiler and we babysit again. Okay guys these are definitely done now. We are gonna put these on the side. We are gonna work on our mixture. What I like to do is use nice, simple, easy ingredients, but the best thing about bruschetta is you can actually add or take out anything that you like or dislike. For instance, you always need tomatoes. That's the core of the bruschetta. I like to use cannellini beans. I like to add a little bit of chopped parsley, some celery for crunch, some salt, pepper and garlic! My favorite tool in the kitchen is the garlic press. I use a garlic press for everything I make. You could also add chopped onion, chopped red onion. I personally am not a big onion fan, but I know a lot of people love to add red onion to their bruschetta. So why don't we start with some tomatoes? We're gonna add the cannellini beans for a texture and a different type of flavor. We are going to add some chopped up parsley, some celery for crunch, some salt, and some pepper. I like to add a touch of balsamic vinegar. You could have used the dark balsamic vinegar or the white balsamic vinegar just for a little tang. And of course some extra virgin olive oil. We are gonna take my famous garlic press, we are gonna put a clove of garlic inside and squeeze it through. The reason why I like to use a garlic press is because, if you're like me, you don't like to bite into a big chunk of garlic. Now we are going to mix all these delicious flavors together, and we are gonna put this on the side, so all the flavors marry together. I am going to take one clove of garlic, chop the end off so you get some of those juices in there and we're gonna take the garlic and rub it on the bread just for a little bit more extra garlicky, delicious flavor. It just gives such a different depth to the bruschetta. We are down to the last step. We are going to take our mixture and we are gonna put it right on top of that bread. Look how beautiful that is. Look at all those colors. Now if you go present this to your family for an appetizer, they're gonna think that this was rocket science to make, and you know what? This was so simple and easy. So coming from an old Italian family, bruschetta has come such a long way. Basically, we called it peasant food, because you're basically using old bread and old ripe tomatoes. But what people don't realize is using old bread and old ripe tomatoes, it makes the flavor so much better. Who wants to eat and enjoy? I know I do! Delicious!

VDMOFa8iRqo,Dr. Greger in the Kitchen: My New Favorite Beverage,"""Dr. Greger in the Kitchen: My New Favorite Beverage"" This is Dr. Greger in the kitchen, where I take the science, and put it into practice. Today I’m going to share with you my new favorite beverage, a vegetable smoothie— I know it sounds kind of gross, but bear with me. The idea for this came out of my research into nitrate-rich vegetables, like beetroot and spinach, shown to improve both oxygen delivery to our tissues by opening up our blood vessels and, amazingly, oxygen efficiency, boosting the amount of power we can extract from each breath, that leads to all sorts of athletic performance enhancing benefits, but most importantly improves lung function in emphysema, brings down high blood pressure, improves peripheral artery disease, boosts cognitive function, and may even enhance longevity by slowing our basal metabolic rate, but something like beet juice is perishable, hard-to-find. I was thinking maybe something like V8 would work, which lists both beet and spinach in their ingredient list, but evidently so little that you’d have to drink 19 quarts a day to get the daily nitrate target dose that I recommend, so I figured, I’ll just make my own. In my new cookbook it’s called ""My V-12 Vegetable Blast"", which is more involved. It starts completely from scratch from fresh tomatoes, and I tweaked it to fit more of a beginner’s palate. I want to show this version that I’ve actually been using whenever happen to be in my favorite exotic locale--home, and not stuck in some airport food court somewhere. It starts with 5 reusable bags, and a stalk of celery goes into each. All of these vegetables are pre-washed. Then 1 carrot in each bag; no need to peel them. You can just use the back of a knife and just scrape off some of the outermost bitter layer. Then a half of a red, orange, or yellow bell pepper in each. What do you do with the half you have left over? Dip it in some hummus, of course. Mmm... Next, one scallion in each with the frilly little tips cut off. Then one fifth of a small beet in each (any more it taste really beety), and then a fifth of a raw jalapeño pepper, which is totally optional but, you know I love things spicey. A quarter inch of fresh turmeric root in each. If you can't find it fresh locally, get it on eBay, serious. It kinda looks like a little turd, but then... you snap it open and the color inside is just gorgeous. Then saving the best for last, the healthiest food on the planet? Greens. Now as you probably guessed what I’m doing is pre-prepping 5 days of smoothies here to make it as convenient as possible to eat as healthfully as possible, and so even though something like arugula has even more nitrates— in fact I think the most nitrate packed food there is— and I think is even tastier, there’s no way it would last 5 days. It starts to turn yellow and get slimy, so what I’ve been using is really hardy greens, like kale and curly parsley. Plus, kale has something spinach doesn't have, it's... cruciferocious. So I’m going to put a cup of each one in each bag. Then all the bags go into the fridge and wait their turn, then when you’re ready to rock and roll, here’s what you do: In a high speed blender pour one cup of a no-salt-added vegetable juice blend, or no-salt-added tomato juice. Then 1 cup of ice cubes, an eighth teaspoon of freshly ground pepper, then a half teaspoon of horseradish— I'm actually using prepared horseradish here, but you could probably grate it yourself. I actually get horseradish root I've never actually tried it fresh, or you could even chop up little pieces and put them in all the bags. If anyone tries that, let me know how it comes out. And then finally the juice from half of a lemon. For a bonus, you can actually zest that lemon. Then cut and juice that half, and save the other half for tomorrow. And that’s what you have to do day-to-day, so just a couple minutes. And this last step is to just throw in one of your bags of veggies. Now, to save even more time what you can actually do is pre-prepare all those wet ingredients where this is about 4 cups, so you could juice 2 lemons into here, 2 tsps of horseradish, add enough of the black pepper, so then there's really only three things, three steps everyday. A cup of the juice mixture, a cup of ice and then one of the bags of veggies, and then you're all set for the day. OK, the final step is to just blend, for 10 burpees. It fits into about one perfect mason jar. Yup, look at that. Then you pop in a reusable straw and… Cold, refreshing, zesty...wooo zesty... And think what’s in this thing. It’s just all vegetables; it's like a mountain of nutrition. It’s hard to imagine a healthier beverage. Ideally, drink it while munching on some walnuts, pumpkin seeds, or a little avocado in there or something; some form of fat to help you maximize absorption of all those fat soluble carotenoid nutrients in there. If you want more recipes like this, incorporating some of the healthiest foods on the planet, check out my new cookbook, the ""How Not to Die Cookbook"", now available for pre-order. It will be out this December, right in time for the holidays. I would say it's a good stocking stuffer, but it's actually kind of big, so your friends and family have to have really big feet, but it makes a great new year- new you type present. As well as all the proceeds I receive from all my books, DVDs, speaking engagements all goes to charity.

Ot2YrxRfMqU,DIY 10 Home Remedies To Whiten Teeth,"One thing that tends to hurt our self-confidence is if we have yellow teeth because we all want to flash a mouth of pearly whites. Whether your teeth have become discolored from aging, coffee, smoking or not properly caring for your teeth, you’re in luck. Today, we will discuss ten all-natural home remedies that are cost effective and deliver results. 1. An Orange Peel You can regularly use a fresh orange peel to reduce the appearance of yellow on your teeth. Just simply rub your teeth with the orange peel each night, before bed. Orange peel contains Vitamin C and Calcium that fight off germs while you are sleeping. Continue to do this each night for a few weeks and you will begin to see results. 2. Baking Soda Since baking soda can clean nearly everything else, it comes as no surprise that it can help to remove yellow stains on your teeth, as well as any plaque buildup. Just mix ¼ of teaspoon of baking soda with your toothpaste. Then, brush your teeth with the mixture. It will be gritty on purpose to act as a tough cleaner. Then, rinse your mouth with warm water. Use this method once or twice a week. You can also mix baking soda with some lemon juice, white vinegar or hydrogen peroxide to act as an oral cleaner. You can make mouthwash by mixing one tablespoon of baking soda with 1 ½ teaspoons of hydrogen peroxide and one cup of cold water. Rinse your mouth with this mixture two to three times daily. Baking soda can also scrub your teeth by using diluted baking soda directly on your teeth. However, do not do this too often. For your first week, use this method twice, then drop to once every fifteen days. This is because too much baking soda can chip away at your tooth enamel. 3. Hydrogen Peroxide is a mild bleaching product. Because of this, it is fantastic in getting rid of the yellow and discolored marks on your teeth. Rinse your mouth using a mouthwash that already contains peroxide. It is important that you never swallow hydrogen peroxide. Try making a paste out of baking soda and hydrogen peroxide, then brush your teeth with the mixture. After rinsing off, brush your teeth with your regular toothpaste. It is important to note that peroxide, in some people, can cause your gums to become irritated and your teeth to become sensitive. 4. Strawberries The Vitamin C in strawberries help them to fight stains on your teeth. Just take a few strawberries and grind them into a paste. Use this mixture on your teeth and rub gently. Use this method twice daily for a few weeks and you will find your teeth brighter and whiter. You can also combine the pulp of one strawberry with ½ teaspoon of baking soda. Put this mixture onto your teeth and leave it there for a few minutes. Then, rinse well and brush your teeth with your normal toothpaste. 5. Salt Salt has the ability to replenish any lost minerals that occur in the teeth and helps to make your teeth white again. Using everyday table salt each morning, brush your teeth just as you would with your regular toothpaste. You can also mix the salt with charcoal and use that to brush your teeth with. You can even mix table salt with baking soda and then rub onto your teeth. One important thing to keep in mind is that too much salt can cause damage to your gums and your tooth enamel. 6. Lemon naturally bleaches your teeth and can be used to get rid of any discoloration. Mix a few drops of lemon juice with some table salt. Put this mixture onto the teeth and rub the paste into your teeth. Keep the mixture on for a few minutes and then rinse your mouth out well with warm water. Repeat this twice a day, for about two weeks, to begin to see real results. 7. Holy Basil The leaves of this plant have whitening characteristics and they can help your body to ward off intruders. Use a few leaves off the holy basil plant and place them in the sun for a few minutes. Once the leaves have dried, grind them until they are powder. Mix the powder into your toothpaste and brush as normal. You can also make a paste of holy basil leaves and mustard oil, which can be used to clean your teeth. 8. Apples When you crunch into an apple, you are getting rid of harmful toxins out of your teeth and making your teeth whiter. To benefit from this, consume one to two apples each day. Be sure to chew the apple thoroughly so that the acids and fibers have plenty of time to clean your teeth. 9. Margosa , or neem, are known for making your teeth white. Margosa kills germs and cleans your teeth. Margosa oil can even help to cure bad breath and help to prevent cavities. 10. Charcoal is one of the best home remedies for discolored teeth. That is because charcoal has strong crystal-based chemicals. You can benefit from this product by mixing some charcoal powder with your regular toothpaste. Repeat this twice per day to make sure your teeth are as white as possible. In place of charcoal, you can use the ashes of burnt bread and burnt rosemary to whiten your teeth.

BzGACeNx0rk,Baking Soda: on Mattress,"The benefits of using baking soda on your mattress, and how to do this at home. 1. Each night we go to bed, and lay on the same mattress. Over time our bodies release dead skin cells which become clogged in the mattress. 2. Particles of dirt and sweat can go through the sheets and get into the mattress. You can use baking soda to give it a fresh clean. 3. To do this simply purchase a large box of baking soda, around 200 grams. Sprinkle this over the entire mattress. Massage this into the fabric with your hands. Try to cover the entire surface that you sleep on. Leave this for 3 hours, and then use a vacuum to hoover the powder back out. 4. The baking soda will absorb sweat and moisture from the mattress, also killing bacteria and parasites. 5. It will also clear out any accumulated dust, preventing dust mites from surviving. These mites can make you itch at night if left unchecked. 6. Baking soda is brilliant for removing stains and lifting dirt particles. 7. I also recommend flipping and rotating your mattress once every 3 months. This will keep it springier for longer. 8. The great thing about baking soda is that it is completely natural, and prevents the need for chemical fabric cleaners. 9. In our previous videos, we showed how you can use baking soda to get rid of cockroaches around the home. 10. You can also take baking soda to cleanse your kidneys, and alkalize your body.

jBG2pPN67NI,DIY Glow-in-the-Dark Stress Balls | Kamri Noel,"(upbeat music) - Hey guys, it's Kamri, and today I'm gonna teach you how to make DIY glow in the dark stress balls. But before we get on to the video, did you hear that Brooklyn and Bailey, my sisters, are writing their own music? Well they are, and I'm super pumped. And they're doing something that nobody else has ever done before, where they're letting you guys help create the songs. You guys can pick out the drum lines by clicking right here and watching their latest video. The sisters are making me so stressed, I think I need a stress ball. (upbeat music) You will need baking soda, glow in the dark powder, hair conditioner, clear balloons, an empty water bottle or funnel, wide mesh material, and floss. Step number one is add seven ounces of baking soda to one fourth a cup of conditioner. You can use whatever scent of hair conditioner that you want. I use coconut because it reminds me of being on the beach or on vacation. Mix all your ingredients together until they're about the consistency of frosting. Also, comment down below if you like frosting as much as I do. Next, add in the glow in the dark powder. I decided to go with the neon pink, and I got this from Amazon. Talk about arm workout. (upbeat music) If you don't already have a funnel at home, you can use this awesome life hack to make one instead. Just cut the neck off an empty water bottle and unscrew the lid. Stretch, stretch, stretch the balloon and then place it on the mouth of the bottle. Now for my favorite part, putting the mixture into the balloon. Do this one scoop at a time because it gets harder as the balloon gets more filled. You might even need to use a Sharpie or something to help you push it all down into the bottom of the balloon. Keep going so you can get all those arm workouts in. Try to get all the air out of the balloon because we don't want no air bubbles in our balloons. They ruin it. And then just tie a knot in the top of your balloon. Now this is the definition of stress reliever. Make sure that you use the right type of mesh. Small holed mesh like from fishnet tights will not work. Bags from oranges, apples, and potatoes works the best. And for our last step, find a piece of mesh that you like and wrap it around the balloon using dental floss. I find this kind of hard to do alone so you can have somebody else hold the balloon while you wrap the floss and tie it. These stress balls are not intended for small children. Ahh, I do believe I'm stress free, thanks to these amazing stress balls. Comment down below if you think that stress balls are amazing like I do.

DZ2z1JqOmEM,7 Brilliant Cleaning Hacks You NEED To Try,"- [Voiceover] Today, we'll tackle some of life's most annoying cleaning situations. So snap on some gloves and let's get scrubbing. Summer's almost here and your grill's been sitting in storage collecting rust and grime. Here's how to quickly mash that problem. Remove your grates from your grill and place them on a flat surface. Fill a small container with vegetable oil and slice up a potato into grippable pieces. Now apply a light coat of oil directly onto the grates. Once that's done, sprinkle coarse salt all over the top. This will help give us an abrasive scrub to remove all the gunk and rust. Simply take your potato slice and apply pressure to the grates while using a scrubbing motion. Make sure to angle the potato in various directions and get in between those grates and hit all those hard to reach areas. It's a simple matter to reuse the salt that has fallen through. Just life the grate, gather it up and sprinkle it right back on top. When that's done, simply rinse your grate with water and place it right back on the grill. The side that we used the potato scrub on is much cleaner than the side we used only the wire brush on. Which would you prefer? Got some old leftovers in the fridge? You may have found that no matter how hard you rinse and scrub the plastic container, it still leaves residue behind. How can you get rid of this? Take your rinsed container outside and place it directly into the sunlight. Now grab a lemon and squeeze out an ample amount of juice into the container. It also helps to scrub the plastic a bit. Put on a lid, give it a shake and flip it over. Leave it in the sun for a few hours and go about your normal business. You can come back and give it a shake or two while you check its progress, but make to leave it out until the stains on the side begin to disappear. That's all there is to it. After enough time your plastic should look as good as new. Don't you hate when you're going to make a delicious smoothie, but end up with a not so delicious mess? There's no need to toss this in the dishwasher. Just pour a couple cups of water into the blender jar and then add a little bit of dish soap. Put the blender on low and fire it up for about 15 seconds. Let the soap foam up good and form a nice coat on the inside. When you're done, just rinse it with water and you should have yourself a nice sparkling clean blending system. If you have a hard to tackle stain that the sponge just isn't taking care of, it might be time to add a little power to the equation. Get yourself a small scrub brush, preferably circular and break it down to its bristles and base. Get a threaded rod and place it right through the center of the brush. Tighten it on both sides with a hex nut until it's snug and secure. Place your apparatus directly into the drill chuck and secure it inside. Now it's time to conquer that stubborn stain. This will certainly work faster and more efficient than good old fashioned elbow grease while allowing you to get rid of stains you thought you never could. If you don't clean your oven's grease filters regularly, you might be in for a shock, but don't fret, there's no need for incessant scrubbing or stress. Simply pop out the filters and place them directly into the dishwasher. You can run it with or without soap and the grease and buildup will just melt away. Once they're clean, pop 'em right back into place and enjoy a nice clean filter to catch all that gnarly cooking grease. Removing paint from a paint brush can be difficult, but it doesn't have to be. Drop a cap full of fabric softener into a cup of warm water and swirl your brush into the mixture until you see the paint just falling off. The paint will settle to the bottom leaving behind a clean brush that just needs a little bit of rinsing. Dry your spring fresh brush out and reshape the bristles so that you're ready for your next paint job. Did your rockin new kicks go through a rough patch with the backyard? No problem. Grab yourself some nail polish remover and a cotton ball or two. Soak the end of the cotton ball and scrub away at the stains on your rubber soles. The nail polish remover will help get rid of everything. Just apply enough pressure to work out the discoloration and you'll end up with a pair of shoes that look as good as new, at least on the outside. If you've got a serious dusting job ahead of you, using a rag or old cloth might give the appearance of cleanliness, but most of that dust just gets spread around to another area. Clorox recently asked us to promote their Clorox Triple Action Dust Wipes and to show our viewers how they can unleash the power. Of course, I wanted to give them a real test before recommending them to you, so check this out. This is my media center that I didn't dust for four weeks in preparation. It's filled with nooks, crannies and electronics. I grabbed one wipe for the entire job and because the wipes are nonabrasive, they're safe for my TV screen, so I started there. This was taken care of with ease and the interlocking weave trapped all the dust inside the wipe. In fact, these are safe to use on any electronics and my gaming consoles definitely needed a face lift. I was able to get deep into the nooks of the machine and really give it an overdo shine. So with one single wipe, I was able to conquer this massive dust pit. Look at the before and after.

SJOlBA0-e9U,DIY DONUT SQUISHY!! Make your own STRESS BALLS EASY!!,"Hey guys! So since I saw Hello Maphie making her squishy panda I've been dying to make one of those. So today i will show you how to make a squishy donut First take a sponge and start shaping the donut with some scissors Start making it round like this. It's actually really easy just take your time. Then make the hole and make it slightly bigger. This was a little more difficult so just be patient. Now that the basic form is ready we will cover it with some magic dough This clay just dries flexible, so it's perfect for our squishy. So as you can see just make the dough flat and place it the sponge. And mould it to fit the shape. Use you finger to poke the hole. And don't forget to cover also the other side. Now it's time for the pink icing. So, just take some more magic dough, and make it flat like this. And use a stick or something similar to draw the shape. Don't worry if it's not perfect. You can fix it later. Remove the excess and place it over the donut. Let this dry for one day. Then I painted some sprinkles with some acrylic paint. But (??) paint works amazing too. And that's it! I loved how it it turned out. It's super squishy and fun. I made mine too big, but if you make a smaller one it's perfect as a keychain.

edWkx_1AOko,10 Money-Saving LIFE HACKS To Try At Home,"- [Voiceover] Life hacking is the art of solving common problems in an efficient manner. An today we've put together 10 quick and simple life hacks for you to MacGyver your way out of any stick situation. If you want the convenience of a dishwasher tablets without the inconvenience of an empty wallet, it's time to make your own. If you combine one cup of washer soda, one cup of baking soda, half a cup of salt, and half a cup of lemon juice, you're well on your way to dish washing freedom. Mix it all in a bowl and compact the mixture deep into some ice cube trays with your thumb. Stick it in the freezer for a quick turn around. Empty out the container and store it in a jar for easy access. They work great, and end up costing you a lot less than prepackaged versions. Super fresh. We all hate carpet spills especially the greasy ones. Grab some corn starch from the pantry and sprinkle it all over the grease spot. Let it sit and do it's job for 15 to 20 minutes. The corn starch will absorb the liquids like nobody's business. And for clean up, just vacuum up the remaining mess and call it a day. Admit it we all have a drawer like this right. Right. Cone on empty toilet paper rolls can be quite useful when dealing with cables that have been in time itself. First radio recycling for some empty TP tubes. Gather and fold up your cables in a semi respectable fashion. slide the bundle of similar cables right into the tube to hold it together and then label it with a marker. With just a few minutes of work you'll save yourself a ton of time in the future when you need to locate that special connect, thanks to the paper rolls. Did you know that according to the original patent filed in 1891, the correct way to hang toilet paper is over the front. Which way do you roll? Now this one might be a bit of a stretch, so bounce with me here. If you have a leaky shower head or faucet, it's possible your connections just aren't sealed well. Now not a lot of people have plumber's tape laying around. But you might have some rubber gloves used for cleaning. Snip off a small portion of glove, and wrap it around the threading, where your leak is a current. Now just screw all the parts back together. And fired up for a nicely sealed solution to your pesky problem. How about getting rid of that plain old cardboard tissue box and making something more unique. Grab a mason jar and take it outside for a little rattle can action. Put a decent coat of spray paint on the jar and the lid. Then let it all dry for about 15 to 20 minutes. Grab your box of tissues and remove about one third of the box while keeping them all folded up as they were. Squeezed them directly into the jar carefully prop out one to serve as a start. Just place the lid back on and the tissue holder is complete. Adding a little style to your boring tissue situation. If you want to get rid of insects in a quick and natural way, it's simple. Mix two tablespoons of sugar, two tablespoons of syrup, in two tablespoons of honey. Stir it heavily in a bowl and then microwave it for 45 seconds. Once you pop it out, give it a little bit more of a stir and let it cool. Cut out several strips of paper from a grocery bag, And slowly and carefully run the strip right through the mixture. Once you're done go ahead and take a paper clip and pop it through the back to use as a hook. Hang it up to dry for just a bit, to get rid of all that excess mixture. And then take it outside and set your trap. You'll probably catch all kinds of things with this. Just be sure to place it far enough from where anyone will be sitting. If you have a lot of oddly shaped glassware you most likely know the struggle of trying to get them nice and clean. If soaking won't fix the problem, try some effervescent tablets like Alka-seltzer. After a quick fizzing in a few minutes of saturation all the weird stain should start lifting from the glassware. After a quick rinse it should be left sparkly and fresh. While stainless steel won't rust or discolor, it sure can collect grease like a champ. If you want to restore that shine, and get rid of the gunk, simply place your pot or pan on the stove and cover the bottom of the pan with some vinegar. Set the stove top to high and bring it to a heavy boil. Boiling until you notice the gunk starting to break off. Take it off the stove. Let it cool. And then add some baking soda and give it a light scrubbing with a brush. This will get rid of any stragglers left behind. That's it, no steel wool needed here. I love making scrambled eggs, but I hate all the dishes that come with it. Reduce your dish footprint by using a cocktail shaker for your scrumptious scrambles. Just crack the eggs directly into the holder. Add a little milk, salt and pepper. And party on in egg delicious ecstasy with no forks or bowls needed. Fry your eggs right into the pan and enjoy yourself a healthy breakfast. Whether it's your fridge or your garbage can, you gotta funky smell in your house and you can't seem to shake it. After you've brewed a delicious cup of joe, gather up the grounds and pour them into a dryer sheet for a little extra olfactory power. Tie off the top and toss your sashe, right into the belly of the best. In a few short hours, that swampy smell will subside. Thank you everyone so much for watching.

apOrUfpTULA,8 Expert Cleaning Tricks using Household Items,"- [Narrator] Whoever said you need expensive cleaners or dangerous chemicals to make your house crisp and clean was dead wrong. In fact, you probably already have everything you need to tackle even the biggest messes. Today we're going to show you eight simple ways to upgrade your cleaning game using common household items. Let's get started. If you're looking for an easy homemade alternative to commercial glass and window cleaners, give carbonated water a try. It's one of the simplest and most effective glass window cleaners, and it's nontoxic and inexpensive. Just pour the fizzy water into a spray bottle. Or, if it fits, simply screw a spray nozzle right onto the bottle itself. Now just spray the surface to be cleaned, and wipe it dry with a soft cloth or newspaper. Now it might take a little bit more wiping than a commercial cleaner because it doesn't dry as quickly. But the extra effort will result in a streak-free shine. If you like fresh air and often leave your windows open, dust and soot can dirty your windowsills. Outdoor sills tend to collect even more since their surfaces trap dirt in pits and cracks. After washing windowsills thoroughly, make future cleaning a breeze by applying a light coat of clear floor finish. You do that with either a sponge or rag. This waxy coat provides an ultra gloss enhancer that will wipe away dirt much more smoothly. Here's a technique that'll remove dust and dirt from your blinds in no time. All you need is an old glove or mitten and some fabric softener. Just pour the fabric softener into a bowl and then put on your glove. Dip your forefinger and middle finger into the small bowl, and slide them along both sides of each slat. This will not only clean those messy surfaces, but it will also slow dust buildup and leave you with the freshest blinds on the block. You probably get so caught up cleaning and disinfecting fixtures and tiles in you bathroom that you forget to look up. Ceilings love to harbor nasty mildew, buildup, and grime. So fill a bucket with equal parts water and white vinegar. Throw on some protective eyewear, and grab your long handled sponge mop. Dip the mop into the solution. Wring it out, and clean one section at a time until your ceiling is as spiffy as the rest of the bathroom. Cleaning a toilet is among one of the most unpleasant things I can possible imagine. But someone's gotta do it. Slowly fill up your toilet as high as you can using a bucket of water, and then toss in three to four antacid tablets, you know, like Alka Seltzer. Let them dissolve and work their magic for about 20 minutes. When time's up, give it a light scrubbing with a toilet brush, and your bowl should be sparkling clean. You might have to flush a couple times though. The sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda, that's found in the tablets makes quick work of nasty toilets with that awesome effervescent action. Oh, and if you don't have any Alka Seltzer, you can try this quick method as well. Pour half a cup of mouthwash into your toilet bowl and let it sit for 30 minutes. Scrub the bowl with a toilet brush and flush. Now you've got a clean and disinfected toilet that smells like fresh breath. Mattresses tend to get a bit stale over time and collect a number of odors, making them difficult to clean. Use a sifter or fine mesh strainer to sprinkle about a cup of baking soda directly onto your mattress. You can even add a few drops of your favorite essential oil directly to the baking soda. Let it sit for about an hour to soak up all those nasty odors, and then vacuum it all up. As a bonus, vacuuming up baking soda is a great way to deodorize your vacuum cleaner as well. If your drains seem to be running a bit slow lately and you don't want to pour nasty chemicals down, try this. Place two cups of white vinegar on the stove and bring them to a strong boil. Now grab some table salt and fill a measuring glass with half a cup. When everything's ready to go, pour the salt right down the drain and then follow it up with the two cups of boiling vinegar. Let it work its magic in the pipes for a few minutes, and then wash everything away with hot tap water. This'll really get those pipes moving, and your drain should be flowing at maximum efficiency.

-bnyJpg0_DQ,Assistant makes a Erupting Volcano in fun Science Experiment,"- [Assistant] Family fun for everyone! (rocket sound) - [Narrator] Hey everyone, watch as the assistant shows ya how to make these erupting volcanoes. Just like this one right here! Whoa, this is gonna be a lot of fun. You can learn more about science. Take a look! (electronic woosh) Hey assistant, what're we gonna make today? - An erupting volcano! - [Narrator] That's right, you're gonna make a volcano that erupts up, right? - So first, we add water. - [Narrator] First thing we gotta do is have our proper safety equipment. So you've got your gloves on, right? Those are special latex gloves. And she's got safety goggles on. - Safety goggles. - [Narrator] Not glasses but goggles 'cause safety first. OK assistant, so the first thing you do is you put your funnel on your jar. And we just made our volcano out of rocks, Kinetic Sand, and Play-Doh, and all kinds of fun things. - And these balls, tiny - And little foam balls too - So first, I'm gonna tell you all the ingredients. So first we have water, vinegar, soap, food coloring and baking soda. - [Narrator] Baking soda. That's right, so add the vinegar first, assistant. - Vinegar, oh. - [Narrator] That's the water. Right there's the vinegar. Yup. Vinegar has a really funny smell, doesn't it? - Yeah. - [Narrator] Do you like the smell of vinegar? - No. - [Narrator] No. Next we add the water. - Oops. - [Narrator] You gotta be really careful, - At least it was water. - [Narrator] Not to spill things, you gotta take extra care. OK, so now she's added the water to it. Now she's gonna put in some soap. Now it says about two tablespoons so I'll let you know when to stop. Little bit more. Little bit more. Now people at home, what color is that soap? - Should I stop? - [Narrator] It's yellow. A little bit more. Just a little more. There you go, that's good right there. Okay, so all that's going down into the funnel into our volcano. And when that's done, what we're gonna do is we're gonna remove the funnel, right? Not quite yet, still gotta little bit more left. OK, remove the funnel. And then we'll add how many drops of food coloring? Three or four. - Lets do four. - [Narrator] Lets do four drops of red dye. This is gonna make it look really red and lavaey more. - One, people at home count. - [Narrator] That's one - One - [Narrator] Two - Two - [Narrator] Three - Three - [Narrator] Four - Four - [Narrator] Four drops of red food coloring. So this is how the volcano works. The water and soap mixed together make soapy water, just like you would have in your bathtub. Then we've got vinegar, and what the vinegar does is it reacts with the baking soda and causes all these bubbles to come up which takes the soap. So you've got the baking soda there (mumbles) Now we don't put our finger in it right? - Right - Sweet little assistant Whataya think's gonna happen? - I think its gonna erupt! - [Narrator] Is it gonna be hot or cold? What color do ya think it's gonna be? - Red - [Narrator] So this is how you do science experiments, you make a hypothesis on what you think's gonna happen and then you see what happens. So, assistant, what kind of gas is gonna be created when the carbon, when the baking soda hits the vinegar, do you know? - No. - [Narrator] All right, I'll give you a hint. Carbon dioxide, just like when we made the Frankenstein globe experiment. Remember? Remember that? - Right - [Narrator] Carbon dioxide? - Yeah. Should we put in the last thing? - [Narrator] Well, I don't know people at home, should we put it in and make our volcano erupt? - Yes. - [Narrator] You think so? - Tell us in the comments! - [Narrator] I don't know, should we do it? - We're just gonna do it right now. - [Narrator] OK assistant, go ahead and add it. Add it all at once. OK, here it goes! - Aw, it's not really red, it's white. - [Narrator] It's comin' up, do you see it, people at home? - Maybe we should add more food coloring? - [Narrator] I think we might have added a little bit, we could add a little bit more. No, you don't add it right now. There is all of the bubbles comin' up. Do you see it? - Was it supposed to rise? - [Narrator] It is, look at how high up it already is. It's gonna start spilling over the top, right? - Right. - [Narrator] Wow. - It's spilling! - [Narrator] There goes the lava down the sides. Assistant needs to move her hand. Yeah, you never in science experiment want to touch it, right? - Right. - [Narrator] Just in case its something that could burn you so you have an adult. Now, should you do this without an adult? - No. - [Narrator] No way. Now if we had used a smaller container, it would have exploded really high, wouldn't it have? - Yeah. Just like a real live one. - [Narrator] That's right, so if we used a smaller container, that's why its just bubbling a little bit over the top. Because if we would have made it too much, it would have exploded really, really, really high, right? - Yeah, that's why you asked me to step back. - [Narrator] That's right. Should we make one that explodes really high? - Yeah. - [Narrator] OK. Lets try that next, OK? - OK. (electronic swish) - [Narrator] OK assistant, this time we're gonna add more vinegar and more baking soda. So what do you think's gonna happen? - Gonna explode? - [Narrator] It's gonna be bigger right? It won't explode but it's gonna have a bigger eruption. So add the first ingredient. - Vinegar - [Narrator] Vinegar. Pour that in. Good job, now we're gonna pour in the water. We're using about the same amount of water as last time. - Yeah. - [Narrator] All right. So you've got all the water in. Now assistant, lets take the funnel out and you can add the food coloring next. Yeah, we'll add the food coloring. That way it should mix it up a little bit better when we add the soap. So one, - One. - [Narrator] Two. - Two. - [Narrator] Three. - Three. Four. - [Narrator] Four. Good Job. OK, now we're gonna put, how about four squirts of soap into our volcano. - OK. - [Narrator] Four squirts. - One. - [Narrator] One. - Two. - [Narrator] Two. - Three. - [Narrator] Three. - Four. - [Narrator] Four. How 'bout a little bit more, one to grow. - Five. - [Narrator] Five, there you go. That one's on the side, that probably'll work ok. All right, and the last ingredient is, why don't we move that soap a little further away. There you go, the last ingredient is the baking soda. Now, assistant, will you add more or less than last time? - More. - More, that's right. So more vinegar and more baking soda. Dump it all in real fast. (screams) - [Narrator] Woah look at it now! That is a volcano! Woah! - Woah! - [Narrator] So we added more soap, I'm sorry, we added more vinegar and more baking soda and we got much more lava, didn't we? - Yeah. But it kinda looks pink. - [Narrator] That's 'cause we probably coulda used a little bit more food coloring in it, right? - Right. Wow. - [Narrator] So that is how you can make a super cool volcano. - Move that cup with the baking soda in it. Now is it a good idea to touch your experiments? - No. - [Narrator] No. Leave it with a parent to make sure that the parent makes sure that it's safe. Now, this one right here is OK because the bubbles are just carbon dioxide. And the soap is just soap, so that's what the reaction is. So that is how we were able to make our super cool what? - Lava! - [Narrator] Volcano with lava. Right, that's pretty fun. All right, assistant, do you think we should do more science experiments? - Yeah. - [Narrator] Me too. - Click here. - [Narrator] So make sure you subscribe to the Engineering Family, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, - And our secret sign word is gonna be, - [Narrator] Volcano V-O-L-C-A-N-O spells - Volcano - [Narrator] So make sure you type in the comments, make sure you check out TF Kids, TF Animal Channels, and TF 123 - TF 123 - [Narrator] Those are three other channels that we have. - And TF 123 is a channel. - [Narrator] It sure is.

d1ufFlXIWjA,Better Know the Great Wave | The Art Assignment | PBS Digital Studios,"SARAH GREEN: This episode is supported by Skillshare and our patrons, especially Indianapolis Homes Realty. You've seen this image before, a giant wave, its distinctive curly claws arched and ready to pounce. It's invoked when natural disaster strikes, but also when it's time to sell beer, jeans, and sweatshirts. It inspired Claude Debussy's orchestral work ""La Mer,"" as well as a not insignificant number of tattoos. It's an omnipresent image and one used towards a variety of ends. Good grief, it's even an emoji. What is it about this image that continues to enthrall us? Let's better know The Great Wave. First off, the title is not The Great Wave. And its subject isn't really a wave. It's one of a series of woodblock prints called 36 Views of Mount Fuji, made by the Japanese printmaker Katsushika Hokusai between 1830 and 1833. Long considered sacred by followers of Shintoism and Buddhism, among others, Mount Fuji is depicted from a variety of perspectives. And the artwork in question is just one of them. Its actual title translates to Under the Wave Off Kanawaga, because under is where Mount Fuji is nestled far in the distance. Also under the wave are fishermen, just trying to get home after delivering fish to the city of Edo, rowing for their lives to escape the wave. But the great wave, of course, dominates the composition and has become an accepted title. Born near modern day Tokyo in 1760, Hokusai was a prominent ukiyo-e artist, the name for the mass produced woodblock prints of the Edo period, notable for their distillation of forms, emphasis on line and pure color, and depictions of hedonistic city life. ""Ukiyo-e"" means floating world, referring to the ephemerality of the fads and fashions of the time. This was not stuffy high art, but images available to a growing middle class for about the cost of a bowl of noodle soup. Hokusai was fascinated by the movement of water, exploring the subjects on many occasions throughout his career, and not just rough seas, but a few calmer moments too. In the 1830s, when The Great Wave was created, Japan was largely shut off to the wider world, due to the isolationist policies of the Tokugawa shogunate then in power. We can see Hokusai borrowing from Japanese Rinpa School artists like Ogata Korin, especially in the tentacle-like projections from his waves. But Western realism was creeping into Japanese art nevertheless, largely due to European engravings smuggled in by Dutch traders. The Great Wave betrays a clear Western influence-- the use of linear perspective, a low horizon line, and the appearance of Prussian blue, a synthetic pigment then very new to Japan, hailing from, that's right, Prussia. Thousands of copies of the Mount Fuji prints were released within Japan, mostly bought as souvenirs by an emerging market of domestic tourists and those making pilgrimages to the mountain. But in the 1850s, after Hokusai's death, trade began to open up, and his work was shown at the 1867 International Exposition in Paris. Japanese culture quickly became all the rage in Europe. And ukiyo-e prints were admired and collected by many, including Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, Mary Cassatt, and a number of artists who were heavily influenced by their depictions of city life, vivid colors, and what for them was a flattening of space. In 1896, a tsunami hit northern Japan, and news of its destruction spread worldwide. It's been hypothesized that this event, coupled with the Japonisme craze, helped propel The Great Wave to international renown. Although the print does not depict a tsunami, in 2009, researchers identified it as a 32 to 39 foot tall rogue wave or what they call a plunging breaker. It would certainly still be deadly, however. And that's where we get to the real and obvious drama of the picture. Nature is large, and we are small. This juxtaposition can be seen in the art of many cultures at many different times. But we have perhaps never seen it played out more clearly and more distinctly than here. Traditional Japanese landscapes of the time put the viewer at a remove from the action. But here, we are right up against this pending disaster. Hokusai's contrast of near and far, and man made and natural, heighten the tension and place us inside the narrative. When Debussy composed ""La Mer"" in 1903, he drew on his own childhood experience of surviving a terrifying storm on a fishing boat, as well as paintings by JMW Turner and Hokusai's print, which he selected for the score's cover. The image later illustrated a 1948 Pearl Buck novel that tells the story of a young boy from a Japanese fishing village who loses his family to a tidal wave, a post-World War II story of grief, but also resilience. It's an image mobilized when disaster strikes, as it was after the devastating 2011 earthquake and tsunami off the eastern coast of Japan. Scientists and empirical evidence tell us that global average temperatures are rising, with extreme weather events becoming more frequent and more intense. While the sea has always been a formidable opponent for human kind and The Great Wave a useful illustration for that relationship, its relevance is likely to become even stronger. But, of course, the image can be interpreted in many different and less specific ways, symbolizing a great many imbalance of power. We don't know if our fishermen are going to make it out of there alive. It's a cliffhanger. Even if you don't register the boats or Mount Fuji and see the wave alone in its detached, emoji state, it still holds us in and tells us quite forcefully that big things are happening or are about to happen. Unlike the GoPro views of surfers tunneling through barrel waves, The Great Wave's story is not one of mastery over nature. It's notably called The Great Wave and not the heroic fishermen who survived the rogue wave. Other artists have capitalized on the power and theatricality of waves as subject matter, but rarely in such a way that we marvel at the talents of the artist, instead of the spectacular beauty of the wave itself. What's more, this image was meant to be reproduced, not sequestered in one museum, where only a few have the privilege of witnessing it. While there are certainly numerous crimes against this image perpetrated across the internet, the crisp, graphic quality of the original woodblock prints make it friendlier fodder for duplication and interpretation. When most of us experience the ocean, this is thankfully not how we usually see it. It's an incredibly improbable view. It's a film still or screen capture in the most dynamic, unstable, and unpredictable of environments. But it has nevertheless become our favorite stand-in for the ocean, a way to isolate some fraction of the vastness that covers 70% of planet Earth. It's an icon. It's the ultimate, most wavelike of all waves. But it's also an entire story told simply and succinctly and masterfully. Whatever your great wave is made of, you are undoubtedly under it and always will be, until you're not. I'd like to think Skillshare for sponsoring this episode.

0tN6MCh2oUM,How to make a cake plate // Woodworking [THE CAKE IS A LIE] | I Like To Make Stuff,"Hey, I'm Bob and I Like to Make Stuff. Today, I'm gonna make a cake plate. For a long time now my wife has been asking me to make her a cake plate, and it's not something I really have ever even thought about how to do, but I'm gonna make myself do it, because right now I need to practice on my lathe. I found this piece of maple in my stock. It's a little bit warped, but I think once I cut it down and make a plate out of it, it'll be fine. And I want to contrast for the stand part, so I'm going to use some pieces of walnut and make some sort of a stand to put underneath it. This project's going to be mostly wood turning, but it's something I really need to practice. Let's try it out. The first step here was to cut down the stock into some usable sizes. First, I needed the walnut down to a square so that I could easily turn it into a circle. Next, I cut the maple down into two pieces and then trimmed them to width on the table saw so that together they made up 11 and 3/4 inches. The maximum size I can turn on my lathe is a 12 inch piece. After gluing these together and putting them in the clamps, I found the center of the piece of walnut by drawing lines from corner to corner. Where they intersect is the center of the piece. At that location I glued in a block to be mounted into the lathe. I also squared up a piece of walnut to use for the stem, and found the center point of both ends of this piece the same way. I set the table of my bandsaw to a 45 degree angle and then push this stem piece through to cut off the corners. This just makes it a little bit less work to turn on the lathe. Then I checked it up in the lathe and started turning it down to get it round. First, I tried to get the whole thing down to roughly a cylinder and get rid of the hard edges. Then I thinned out the center section so it flared out toward the ends of it. Once I was happy with the shape, I slowed the speed down and used some sandpaper to get a nice smooth finish. I experimented a bit with adding some grooves in different locations to try to add some detail to this so it wasn't just a solid shape. And eventually I used a parting tool to separate the piece from the piece that was in the chuck. I was a little scared to do this for the first time, I kept expecting the piece to fly off, but as I got closer to the center I stopped the lathe and used a saw to cut it loose. With that done, I pulled the other pieces out of the clamps and got them ready to turn on the lathe. I did this by cutting off the hard corners on the bandsaw. I got a little bit ahead of myself when I glued that block on there because it turns out that it was too big to fit in the chuck that I have for my lathe, and I also just don't even need it. I went ahead and just cut it off with a bandsaw to get rid of it. I'm gonna screw it on to the faceplate instead, and then this side with the holes in it will just end up being the bottom. Luckily the X I had drawn was still on this piece of wood so I lined it up with the holes of the faceplate to try to get it centered as best as I could. In the end it got turned down to a circle regardless of how off-center it was to start with. First, I got rid of the hard edges and got it down to a perfect circle. Then, I rounded over what would be the top edge before flipping around the tool rest and flattening out what would end up being the top surface. The pieces of maple that I'd glued together for the top still had the warp and it was really obvious, so I ran this piece through the planer - luckily it just fit within the size of my planer. After one side of that was flat, I found the center point again, and then used that center point to draw a circle that I knew would fit on my lathe. If you wanted a plate that was larger than the capacity of your lathe you could just cut it out on the bandsaw and do your best to get it as circular as possible. But for me this project is mostly about lathe practice. So I turned the piece down to a perfect circle on the outside and then started flattening down the top of the plate surface. Once I did a few passes to get the surface flat, I went a little bit deeper starting at the center point all the way to the outside edge, but leaving a small rim around the outside of the plate. I don't quite have the control enough to get a perfectly flat surface, so I still did have to do some sanding to get a nice, even surface on the top. Even though this is really beautiful wood grain, it didn't quite have enough nerd in it, so I decided to laser on a small joke. If you know the video game ""Portal"" at all, you'll know that ""the cake is a lie"" is a joke that runs through that, so I thought it would be fitting to put that on a cake plate. I drilled a hole up from the bottom of the base to drive a screw into the shaft, but I also wanted to make a mortise for this to sit in. So I used a Forstner bit to make a hole in the center of the top of the base and the bottom of the plate, and then put the stem in between those with some wood glue. I also drove a screw up through the bottom of the base into the shaft to hold those together and then added some weight to the top of this while it dried. I used spray lacquer to finish this, and just to note - any finish is food safe once it's fully cured. Here it is all finished up, and to be honest the only thing I like about this is the top. I think the top is really pretty. I really like the engraving that we put on it. But the stand, I'm just not happy with. I don't think the pedestal has enough detail, I think the base is way too plain, even though It's a pretty piece of wood, it could definitely use some more detail to make it more interesting to look at. And I think that's really just a condition of me not knowing my way around the lathe that well. It's hard for me to picture ahead of time what the details are going to look like until I cut them in, so I'm a little bit apprehensive of actually doing a bunch of work on something like this. I was kind of worried that I would end up wasting this whole big piece of walnut, when in reality I definitely should have spent more time adding more shape and more curves to it. I also figured out another thing about the lathe that I'm really not comfortable with yet, and that's just the order of operations. I haven't thought through enough how these pieces need to be mounted so that I always know where the center point is on both sides of every piece just in case I need to remount it on the lathe. I haven't figured out the most effective way to chuck things up and mount pieces yet. And I think that all just comes with experience. So even though I'm not really that happy with this particular project, it was another step towards me being more comfortable with the lathe and learning a little bit more of what I don't know and in the end I set out to make a cake plate and I made a cake plate. Let me know what you think about this project down in the comments below and I've got lots of other types of projects that you may be interested in. Be sure to check some of those out here.

uUCqvv_mtHA,10 Awesome Baking Soda Life Hacks,"- [Voiceover] If you wanna get to the top, (dramatic orchestral music) you gotta know the tricks of the trade. Brains over brawn, mind over matter. You don't come this far without setting a few fires. Take a seat. It's time you learned my secrets. (dubstep music) Let's talk about baking soda. No, no, no, not like that. (upbeat pop music) I mean the magical powder that you keep in the pantry. We've put together an awesome list of baking soda uses that'll compel you to pull it from under the sink and bring it into primetime. Wanna make a more natural air freshener that smells great? Pour yourself two cups of water into a spray bottle. Bust out your finest lemons, oranges, or limes and do a little slicing. We're gonna want about half a cup of citrus juice, which is usually two to three fruits. Squeeze it off carefully and pour it right into your spray bottle. Now, add about one tablespoon of baking soda to your bottle, add the top, and give it a good shaking. Spray it in stinky areas for a long-lasting, more natural approach to pleasing your olfactory senses. Baking soda, being the scientific marvel that it is, can also be a crowd-pleaser at your next party. Simply take together four parts powdered sugar and one part baking soda. Mix it all up good. Dump it into a container that can handle a lot of heat and add about one part rubbing alcohol to the powder. Next, we're gonna light it. We'll be dealing with a chemical reaction, so safety is of the utmost importance. Eye protection should be worn and a fire extinguisher nearby. Grandpa, wanna see something cool? - Sure! - If you're a minor, make sure you have adult supervision. As the mixture burns, the baking soda is going to create a lot of carbon dioxide, which in turn fluffs up the burnt sugar, forcing it out of the container as it continues to grow. What you're left with resembles a burnt marshmallow, but don't eat it. Now, how about a different kind of reaction? I'm talking about surprise. By adding a single tablespoon directly into a ketchup bottle, the groundwork is laid for a shocking surprise. Now, I don't recommend trying this, but theoretically, if you were to lightly flip the bottle over to hide the powder inside and then maybe put it back in the fridge, it's entirely possible, theoretically, of course, that an unsuspecting victim might grab it and kick off the chemical reaction. The movement and shaking of the bottle will cause the baking soda to react with the vinegar that's in the ketchup. All the contents in the bottle will quickly spray out, leaving behind quite a cleanup job. Now, that's saucy. The human foot has over 250,000 sweat glands, glands that leak into your shoes and cause odor. Let's get rid of that odor. Grab a paper towel and sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda into the center. Now, fold it over itself a couple times to fit in your shoe to leave overnight. Baking soda stabilizes the pH levels of acidic odors. Most foot odor is acidic, which is why it can smell like vinegar or even cheese. But rest assured, after a baking soda treatment, your shoes will be back to their questionable-smelling selves. Now, this is the time of year when our grills get neglected and the thought of cleaning 'em seems overwhelming. To make this an easy task, mix three parts baking soda and one part hot water into a container. Stir and blend until you have a nice paste form. Dip in a grill brush and spread the mixture around before moving into some quick scrubbing. The caked-on material will come right off in a matter of seconds, leaving you with a grill that's ready for action. If you do a lot of cooking, you know that sometimes things don't go as planned. If you run into a grease fire, there isn't a lot of time to react. But if you keep baking soda around, you can safely stop the fire in its tracks by pouring it over the flame. While this does ruin your food, it also saves you a visit from the fire department. Feet and pets hit our carpets on a daily basis, and after a while, they need a good refresh. You can make your own carpet powder that's more effective than store-bought versions by grabbing one cup of baking soda and a small bottle of essential oil. Put the powder in a bowl and add about 25 drops of your favorite scented oil. Mix it up good and work out all of the clumps. For easy storage, I cleaned out a Parmesan cheese bottle and added the carpet powder. You simply sprinkle it on your affected areas and then let it sit for 15 minutes. After that, vacuum it all up and enjoy a fresh-smelling and clean carpet. Now, here's a quick way to deal with clogged drains without harsh drain cleaners. Simply pour a cup of baking soda right into the jammed-up drain and, once settled, follow it up with a cup of vinegar. The reaction between the two substances will help unclog and even freshen up your drain. Many of us experience heartburn when eating spicy foods. Generally, you grab a Tums or some acid reducer. But let's say you ran out or you can't find it. Baking soda to the rescue. Add half a tablespoon of your magical powder to a glass, followed up with a cup of water. Make sure to stir it well and then fire it down your eager gullet. It doesn't taste great, but it will nullify your heartburn and let you get back to cleaning up your dishes. Plastic containers are notorious for getting food stains stuck inside. Washing and scrubbing doesn't always do the trick, leaving you with discoloration on your lovely Tupperware. To beat those hard stains, sprinkle baking soda inside the container, making sure to cover all the exposed areas. Add a small amount of water that leaves the mixture a bit thick and shake it around like a madman until the inside of the container has a nice coating. Set it aside and let it sit overnight. After several hours in the mixture, pop off the lid and give it a good rinse. The stains'll be gone and your plastic container will smell great and look like new.

BY3SLVNBkeo,How to keep cats entertained! - Simon's Cat | LOGIC #12,"Hello I'm Simon, welcome to Simon's Cat Logic, we'll be finding out from a cat expert why cats behave the way they do. Today we're finding out about 'Playtime'. Well over the years, my cats have had hundreds of toys, they have had little mice they have had little bells, little balls that go everywhere, and most of these toys have ended up under the sofa, or under the fridge. Teddy's favourite toy is actually this simple piece of string and this is his actual favourite toy in the world. It shows like he's been mauling this all day long and what I like to do is just put a little knot in the end to give it some weight, and that helps weigh it down when you drag it along the floor. And then you twitch it, like it's a little animal with little erratic movements and that will drive your cats crazy. He will chase this all day long if you go outside and put this through the long grass, he is just the happiest cat in the world. If you have an indoor cat, you may be wondering how much exercise or play that they need. Certainly cats that are indoor only, would require more exercise and play then a cat that has outdoor access. Although there's no definitive amount of time a cat should play, indoor only cats should have multiple short play sessions throughout the day. It's important not to play with kittens or cats using the hands or toes as this will teach them that they're a fun toy. This can be very painful for owners. It's much better to use something like a fishing rod toy such as this which keeps the play safely away from hands. And as you can see from Nigel, they absolutely love them. The great thing about fishing rod toys is that you can use them to show different styles of play. So, for example whether you have it up in the air like this or if you run it across the ground a bit like a mouse. So if you are using a fishing rod toy, it's best to avoid dangling the toy in front of the cat's face. Cats are far sighted meaning they can't see that well under 25 centimeters. Cats much prefer it to have the fishing rod toy moving it away from the cat, similar to how prey would move. Fishing rod toys are great because they allow the cat to catch and kill the toy giving cats the opportunity to be successful releases endorphins or happy hormones and makes them feel good. This is why laser toys can sometimes be frustrating and may be best avoided but if you do use a laser toy always end the game on a physical toy like a mouse so the cat has the opportunity to catch and kill something. Other small toys such as balls, string mice and ping-pong balls can be very exciting for cats to play with. We'd recommend that owners experiment with different types of toys as well as different styles of play to find out what their cat prefers, but however you play with your cat, it's lots of fun for them and for us and it helps reinforce the bond between the owner and their cat. Well, my cat Hugh who was the inspiration for Simon's Cat used to love a little laser toy, a little mouse laser toy, and it had a little keyring at the back, and whenever you rattled that keyring, he would run from wherever he was... asleep or in the garden, he would come shooting in and start to try to hunt that little red dot. Funnily enough the other cats weren't that bothered about it. Little Teddy used to have a little go, but then used to lose interest, but Hugh would just follow that thing all day long, he absolutely loved it. That was definitely his favourite toy!",Hobbies and Crafts,Crafts,Clean a Cat Scratching Post,True,3476,en-GB,en-GB

4k4EfaFwiSM,9 Reasons Why You Should Add Epsom Salt To Your Bath,"Epsom salt provides a wealth of health and beauty benefits. Its secret ingredient is the chemical compound magnesium sulfate. The body uses magnesium to regulate hundreds of enzymes and also plays a vital role in many bodily functions. A magnesium deficiency can result in high blood pressure, osteoporosis and migraines. Sulfate plays a role in the formation of brain tissue and improves the body’s absorption of essential nutrients. Since magnesium sulfate can be absorbed through the skin, regularly submerging in an Epsom salt bath can be extremely therapeutic. In today’s video we’ll highlight the top health benefits of Epsom salt. 1. Eases Aches &amp; Pains The next time your body has aches and pains, reach for Epsom salt. Its magnesium can alleviate swelling and inflammation. It also has been shown to help lower high blood pressure, and prevent osteoporosis and migraines. Magnesium reduces stiffness, inflammation and most pain associated with arthritis, including gout. This miracle worker assists in bone mineralization, promotes nerve functionality and soothes nerve pain. Three times a week, add 2 tablespoons of Epsom salt to a hot water. Soak for 20 – 30 minutes. 2. Aids Detoxification The magnesium in Epsom salt assists in eliminating harmful toxins from the body and detoxifies cells to flush out environmental contaminants. To enjoy a relaxing detox bath, add 1 to 2 cups of Epsom to a warm bath 2 to 3 three times a week. Soak for about 20 minutes 3. Stress reliever Epsom salt can relieve stress, which can drain the body of magnesium and increases adrenaline levels. It also can trigger the release and uptake of serotonin, a mood-enhancing chemical in the brain. The proper levels of serotonin regulate anxiety, and creates feelings of well-being and relaxation. Three times a week, add 1 cup of Epsom salt to a warm bath and soak for 20 minutes. 4. Relieves Muscle Cramps Epsom salt is a great remedy for treating muscle cramps or relieving sore muscles after workouts. The magnesium reduces inflammation which eases pain. This in turn promotes muscle relaxation and healing. Make a thick paste of Epsom salt and hot water. Apply it on the affected area for 15 to 20 minutes for soothing comfort. 5. Improves Digestion Epsom salt assists in the elimination of harmful toxins and waste products from the body and the digestive system. It also works as a laxative in treating constipation. Dissolve 1 or 2 teaspoons of Epsom salt in 1 cup of warm water. Drink on an empty stomach once a day. 6. Adds Volume to Hair Epsom salt can add body to your hair, remove excess oil from your scalp and keep both healthy. Over time, chemicals in shampoos and conditioners can accumulate on the scalp and can result in oily hair, thinning hair and hair loss. The minerals in Epsom salt can repair and strengthen damaged hair. To make a voluminous hair mask, mix equal parts of a warm deep conditioner and Epsom salt. Apply to slightly damp hair. Leave on for 15 to 20 minutes. Rinse thoroughly with cold water. Note: Only use this treatment once a week. If you have oily hair, add a little bit of Epsom salt to your shampoo and wash your hair as usual. Do this no more than twice a week. 7. Exfoliates Skin To maintain a healthy, glowing complexion, it’s essential to exfoliate once or twice a week to eliminate dead skin cells. Exfoliation also removes excess oil from skin pores so your skin doesn’t become fertile ground for itchiness, pimples, blackheads and other common problems. Gently rub a handful of Epsom salt over damp skin to remove dead skin cells. Rinse with warm water and pat dry. 8. Improves Heart Health Epsom salt is also heart friendly. The magnesium improves blood circulation, which decreases the chances of heart disease and strokes. Magnesium helps maintain a normal heart rhythm and healthy arteries. Healthy arteries will mean there is less risk of developing blood clots, plaque buildup and damage to arterial walls. Enjoy an Epsom salt bath 3 times a week to improve your cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of heart attack. 9. Alleviates Foot Problems Rough and callused feet also need tender care. Epsom salt can soften dry, rough heels. Its natural properties work wonders in diminishing foot odor, and also improve athlete’s foot and other foot problems. Add ½ cup of Epsom salt to a foot tub filled with warm water and soak for 10 minutes daily. Symptoms should improve soon. When taken internally, Epsom salt can cause adverse side effects, including gastrointestinal irritation, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Consult your doctor before taking Epsom salt. Do not take it longer than 1 week.",Education and Communications,Subjects,Grow Crystals from Epsom Salt,True,4646,en,en

7VQ7xDSmmdo,DIY Plastic Spoon Flowers - Man Vs. Pin #38,"Spoons. Spoons. Pretty weird word. What's up? You're watching Man vs. Pin, the show where you send me all sorts of weird DIY projects and I make them here in this weird little apartment. This week's project was suggested by pixmyae and liked up by nearly 100 of you, this plastic spoon flower broach necklace thing. I clicked it, and it led me over to this website which is all in Japanese. Maybe one of these means translate? Nope, that made it smaller. Nope, that turned it upside down. Why would you want to do that? Oh well, I got some spoons and a pair of cutters and began cutting my spoons. Whoa, these things are [beep] dangerous. Jesus. It's like little [beep] spoon torpedoes. After I had a good assortment of spoon heads, I got some needle nose pliers and a candle and began to melt my spoon over the flame. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on. Whoa, we had a fire. What the [beep] was that all about? All right, let me try another one. This is some highly flammable [beep] right here. All right, the first tip is don't get your plastic spoons from the 99-cent discount store. There's a reason they're there. I got some different spoons. Let's see if these work. All right. These are a lot better. So I just took the needle nose plier, and I just held the spoon over the flame until it started melting, and I guess that's when it's finished. Some of them caught on fire. Another good amount suffered from black burn marks. Some would burn holes. The smell was absolutely terrible—super [beep] toxic plastic burning fumes of death. Cancer everywhere. By the time I was finished, these were some pretty [beep] up looking spoons. All right. On to the next step, burning all the spoons together. To start I picked out a spoon petal that I would use for my center and then began adding more spoon petals around it in a little circular fashion. I did this one at a time by melting the handle side of my spoon on the fire and attaching them around the center piece. I used my pliers to mend each one of the pieces into place. I also used my finger for some of it, which was kind of [beep] stupid. Nearly dead from the fumes, I finally finished my flower spoon petal thing. And you know, here it is in all its glory, all its beauty. Ta da! All right, now I'm going to be completely honest with you here. I came into this project thinking that this thing was just going to turn out like a big piece of [beep] in the first place. So I really didn't put that much effort into making it. But then something happened where it all kind of came together and looked pretty decent. Obviously it's got the burn marks on it, but I'm going to take care of that, nothing that a can of white spray paint can't help. I took it outside, sprayed it down a little bit, and goddammit, this thing looks [beep] halfway decent. the back is a little shitty, but you won't see that. You could throw it on a necklace, you know, like in the pin. Boom. Yep. This is what I do for a living. If you see any pins out there that you want to see here on the show, let me know about them in the comments below. And hey, the holidays, right around the corner, so start thinking about that. Huh?

-lES_4lZRPw,21 Mistakes French Speakers Make in English - part 1,"Ah France. What a wonderful country! Voltaire Beaujolais Nouveau Fromage Nouvelle cuisine Hello and welcome to LetThemTalk. My name's Gideon and I've been living in France for more than 10 years I like the country, I love the French language but I'm and English teacher and when it comes to speaking English the French make the same mistakes every time. listen to this so my student said to me. ""I was sitting in a coffee reading my book"" and I said ""mmm it must have been very big cup of coffee."" In English ""coffee"" is the name of a drink and a ""café"" is a place where you can drink it. This is the first of 21 mistakes French speakers make when speaking English. ""to agree"" is a verb so do say ""I agree with you"" and not ""I am agree with you"". A business that tries to make a profit is called a ""company"" not a ""society"". This word is pronounced ""idea"" with 3 syllables. an ID is your identity card. ""Information"" has no plural. so ""informations"" is not correct instead say ""some information"" or count with ""pieces"" for example I've got 2 pieces of information for you. you ""sit"" or ""take"" an exam and if you are successful you ""pass"" it. The two types of food that you might eat are sweet and savoury. ""Salty"" means it contains a lot of salt. If you are sick you call a doctor. ""Medicine"" refers to the drugs the doctor will give you to make you better. A ""bookshop"" is a place where you buy books while a ""library"" is a place where you borrow them It you are talking about dates say for example ""it is the 5th of November"" &amp; NOT ""We are the 5th of November"" A ""stranger"" is a person you don't know while a ""foreigner"" is a person from a different country to your own. In English ""email"" is the word for electronic correspondence and not ""mail""&nbsp;which are letters sent by post. These word are pronounced ""psychology"" and ""psychiatry"". Don't &nbsp;say the ""planning"" when you mean a timetable or schedule. Don't confuse Tuesday and Thursday. To help you remember Tuesday sounds a little like ""2"" Tuesday, 2sday and it's the second day of the week An avocado is a fruit. A person in the legal profession is a lawyer. If you say ""I spoke to an avocado yesterday"" then you are weird Don't say ""I took the &nbsp;subway"" if you are in France In Paris you take the Metro, in New York the Subway and in London the underground or tube. A ""dinner"" is you big meal of the day. A ""diner"" is a synonym for a restaurant or a customer at a restaurant. A place where you pay little or no tax such as the Bahamas is called a ""tax haven"" not a""tax heaven"". Look at this picture. What do you call it in English. The correct word is a ""chateau"" (if it's in France or in the French style.) don't confuse it with a castle is for military use or a palace is a royal place of residence such as the Palace of Versailles. Any finally a student asked me ""Does London miss you?"" You miss something or someone A more common question would be ""Do you miss London?"" That's it!

PamvTDPzyKE,HOW TO GET PAID TO TRAVEL THE WORLD,"What's up guys? I'm Alex, and I'm Marko. And we are the Vagabrothers. And this video is about how to get paid to travel the world. These days we travel the world through this YouTube channel. But before we started vlogging, we worked a number of different jobs to fund our travels. The key to long term travel is finding jobs that will take you to new places, help you save cash, and let you travel in your free time. Here are ten ideas: number 1. Teach English Teaching English is a great way to immerse yourself in foreign culture, learn a new language, and travel on the weekends. In countries like the UAE or Korea, the pay is high and they'll often time cover accomdations and flights, which is a great option if you have student loans. In countries like Spain where we tought English for three years, the pay wasn't really high, buy it gave us plenty of free time to develop the skills we needed to start this You Tube channel. Mas fiesta! Number 2: tour guide. Working as a tour guide is a great option, especially if you speak another language, or if you studied something relevant. You can find companies at home that operate abroad, but sometimes it's just best to show up and find a job on the spot. Plus, you can always offer free tours and ask for tips. Number 3: work on a cruise ship or yacht. Modern cruise ships are enormous with over a 1000 crew, ranging from fitness instructors to cooks. Now the pay is not high, and the hours are long, but you get to travel to dozens of countries, and it's a good option if you come from a relatively lower wage economy. On the other end of the spectrum, you could work on a private yacht, but this usually requires some sailing experience as well as a maritime safety certification. Number 4: work remotely. These days certain jobs can be done from anywhere, whether it's programming to graphic design or freelance writing and photography. Websites like Upward can help you find work as a freelancer, or hire other freelancers to help you take your show on the road. The key is ""Geo Arbitrage"" earning money in a strong currency and spending it where life's a little bit cheaper. Think Southeast Asia. A good resource to learn more is Timothy Ferriss' The 4- Hour Workweek. Seriously, read the book. Number 5: become a flight attendant. For the young and single, becoming a flight attendant is an excellent option. Depending on your routes, you can visit multiple countries every month, and perks include free flights and discounts across travel industry. Not for you, then just fall in love with a flight attendant or a pilot. Thank You. Enjoy your flight. Bye. Benefits extend to family members for life. Want something more settled? Be an au pair It's not a fruit:) It's French for nanny. There's plenty of websites that will match you with a host family in your country of choice, giving you a salary, visa, and accommodation. Plus, living with a host family is the best way to immerse yourself in local culture. For the accademically inclined, consider getting a graduate degree abroad. School is free in many European countries, and in Scandinavia, they even pay you to go to school. Say what? Seriously. There are also scholarships that will fund you to do research abroad. We wrote a blogpost on this topic, and we will put a link in the info box. Number 8: work fot the government. Diplomatic types can apply for the foreign service, volunteers for the Peace Corps, and of course you can always join the military. Or if you've got a troubled past and in the market for an EU citizenship, you can always join the French Foreign Legion. Qui Monsieur! Number 9: apply for a transfer. Most major cooperations have offices overseas, often times in really cool countries with a lower cost of living. So instead of quitting your job, you could just outsource yourself. Apply for a transfer for 6 months to a year, and that could be even better than getting a raise or the corner office. Number 10: start a travel blog or vlog. That's what we did. Success by no means is guaranteed, and it's probably going to take a long time. But, if you do it in conjunction with some of these other jobs, it could become your main source of income in no time. In sometime. In sometime. All right guys, well those were our tips on how to get paid to travel the world. If you have any of your own, make sure you share them in the comment box below. Also if you enjoyed the video, make sure to give it a thumbs-up, share it with your friends, and subscribe to Vagabrothers if you haven't already. All right guys. There is also a blog post on Vagabrothers.com with more information. If you want more travel tips, click the video here on the left, or on the right. You can see some of our more recent adventures. In the meantime, stay curious, keep exploring, and we'll see you guys on the road. Peace.",Hobbies and Crafts,Crafts,Make a Tube Top,True,4841,en,en
coQ2tllkGms,10 Surprisingly High Paying Jobs,"Are you thinking about changing careers but feeling intimidated about the education and licensure associated with well-paying jobs? Exactly how much GRUNT work does it take to get the GRATIFICATION of a new career making at least six figures? We did the math on the grunt-to-grat ratio for you, with 10 jobs you wouldn't expect to be well-paying, and the details on what it takes to land the position, in this episode of The Infographics Show, 10 Surprisingly High Paying Jobs. Don’t forget to subscribe and click the bell button so that you can be part of our Notification Squad. Number 10. Railroad conductor Up to $104,000 Did you know that in the U.S., professionalized railroad conductors are still around? Neither did we, but they exist, and they cash in in some areas. The national median salary is just $54,000, but it does go all the way up to $104,000. The grunt is working your way up in a dying industry and learning on the job without many mentors or companies to choose from. You’re away from home for long periods of time. But the grat is you get to see the country in an old timey kind of way, you get to feel like that kid you once were with your first train set, and you can avoid the 9 to 5 and tell corporate America to kiss your – uh – caboose. All aboard! Number 9. Crab fisherman Up to $200,000 Tolerating the miserable work of capturing crab through terrifying squalls for five figures per month was popularized by Discovery Channel’s reality series The Deadliest Catch. Even negotiating the dynamic between the personalities on board seems treacherous enough to think twice. But in recent years, changing safety regulations have made fishing for Dungeness crab more doable. There is also an after-season for other kinds of crab, as well as fish. All said and done, you can still clear $200,000 a year after a few years’ experience. The grunt work is working your way up, because there is no school for crab fishing. You have to find a crew you trust and respect to show you the ropes when you start as a deckhand. And you’ll be away from home and leave your loved ones behind to worry. The grat is having a nontraditional career and six figures to roll hard on your few days on land. Number 8. Building inspector Up to $117,000 It’s not super scintillating, but if you’re good with checklists and you have a mind for structural engineering, working for a city government inspecting buildings could bring home six figures. The grunt part is working your way up in the kind of large bureaucracy – that is, a major U.S. city – that is big enough to pay at least $68,000 per year, and all the way up to $117,000 per year. It’s also highly specialized, so you’ll give up other career tracks. And there are a few months of studying for a standardized exam. But the grat is a well-paying job with predictable days and permanent demand for your skills. Number 7. Egg donor Up to $114,000 Here is one for the ladies. It can be lucrative, but it has its dilemmas. And it’s not really a job, as in an existing role in any company, but an opportunity you could make your full-time gig if you’re really, really determined to get some cash. The grunt is altering your cycle, feeling like a human petri dish, and the whole ethical conundrum of creating a human you’ll never meet. But the grat is up to $14,000 per cycle, so you could, if you go on back-to-back cycles and take two months off, clear $140,000 in a year. Number 6. Anesthesiologist Up to $500,000 Anesthesiologists, in their quiet bedside role near the superstar surgeon, look like some kind of low-level nurse or technician. They’re actually doctors, and they make bank. The grunt is med school like any other doctor. That’s completing a four year degree, doing the MCAT preparation to take the standardized exam to get into a decent medical school, then going through four years of medical school, and four years of residency that actually comprise a one-year internship plus a three-year residency. Some anesthesiologists do additional residencies beyond those 12 years mandatory, and then have to study and take the board exam to become board-certified. That board certification is an important credential to earn the trust involved in taking someone safely through a major surgery and recovery. But then the grat is you make more than a family doctor, general practitioner, pediatrician, or psychiatrist does. That is, anesthesiologists take home, on average $294,811. That is a national average. In larger U.S. cities their annual salary is in the $400 to $500 thousand dollar range. Number 5. Write for the federal government Up to $123,234 A writer-editor for the State Department, in which you don't do any foreign policy analysis or speech writing, but analyze communication documents and systemic functions of the department itself, grosses you $95,000 to $123,000 per year. If you'd like to do something similar for the Department of Energy, and recommend standards for documentation for audits and other reports, you could start as low as $79,000, but also go up to $123,000. The grunt is working your way up in a dull bureaucracy and memorizing templates and standards and learning to speak bureaucratese. The grat is the money, the great benefits, and the job security. Number 4. Longshoreman Up to $200,000 This job loading and unloading ship cargo at large ports is of course only available if you’re near a big port like Houston, Los Angeles-Long Beach, or New York – or are willing to move. But you might be willing, for the money. There is no education requirement – just experience. West Coast longshoremen average $98,000 according to shippingwatch.com, but with overtime and union power to play hardball on negotiations, that salary gets north of $100,000. And an LA Times analysis in 2015 showed over half of longshoremen made over $100,000, while foremen and managers top $200,000. A few bosses get $300,000, and all get free healthcare. A New York longshoreman makes at least $124,000, with another round of negotiations coming up in 2018. The grunt is working your way up and the intense physical labor with never ending stacks of cargo waiting to be moved. But the grat is the cash, the health care, and holding one of the few jobs that globalization actually needs. Number 3. Mine operator – underground Up to $165,000 It’s not for you if you’re scared of tight spaces, and it’s not glamorous, literally digging around in the dirt. And there’s this coal miner image out in the pop culture lexicon of being, well, white trash. But you can laugh all the way to the bank, because if you’re willing to work underground, you’ll clear $150,000 to $165,000. The grunt is learning the trade on the job, the danger, the dirt, and taking such a specific career track that it doesn’t prepare you for much else. But the grat is the earnings. And while automation continues to improve mining, you’re not being replaced by a robot quite yet. That is, you will be in demand for a while. Number 2. City employees – at least those of affluent towns Up to $142,903 You can actually make more than $143,000 without any education requirements in some cities, like Santa Monica. But we picked the silliest job in that particular city that pays six figures: farmers market manager. In fact, 105 City of Santa Monica workers cleared over $300,000 in 2016, to the horror of watchdog blog Transparent California. The city’s global caché and resulting steady stream of tourists, produce high occupancy taxes – that is, the city’s share of hotel bills – and parking taxes, filling city coffers and boosting salaries for all jobs. The grunt is a dull bureaucratic job – and perhaps your nagging conscience if you happen to be the Assistant City Librarian bringing home $220,558, or occupying another overpaid post. The grat is, well, you’re overpaid and you’re in sunny Santa Monica, or another rich city living large. Number 1. Firefighter Up to $121,104 as a starting firefighter Mmm, running into burning buildings and maintaining the fitness level to regularly charge flights of stairs. Maybe not? Think again: it has its advantages. Salaries vary by city and position, but in major cities like New York and LA, you’ll clear six figures. You’ll make at least $121,000 from Day One in Los Angeles, but in New York, you’ll have to work for five years to get to $110,000 as a low level firefighter. But then you get promoted on your way to Chief and earn more at each level, over $300,000 in some fire departments. The grunt is you’re working in fire, putting yourself in danger, worrying about your coworkers, dealing with deeply distressed people who are watching their homes and offices burning, and you’re also a paramedic, meaning you have to see terrible injuries from violence and witness other human loss. But you work days at a time and then have chunks of time free, so you can travel and buy toys with the six figures you’re earning, with solid job security. And you get to contribute to your community and truly help people every time you go to work. So, which of these high paying jobs took you most by surprise?

i7Lgvl9qDLQ,Diagonal Basket Weave Stitch | Cable Knitting Pattern,"The Basket Weave Stitch! This is diagonal and has a woven, braided look! Hi, guys! I'm Kristen and welcome to Studio Knit. Today, we are knitting up this beautiful Basket Weave Stitch and it is a very tight stitch, so I think it is perfect for pillows and other home decor items. So, we're going to be using regular knitting needles and yarn, of course, as well as a cable needle. Now, you can purchase a specific cable needle, but I'm using here is a double pointed needle that I painted pink to help you differentiate between my needles. And, of course, we begin with our beloved slip knot. I have the instructions here on the left and we are going to be casting on in multiples of two. So, row one, we start with two knit stitches, so that's K2 and then we're going to be repeating between those asterisks there. So, to begin, we slip two stitches. So, we're going to take this cable needle and insert it into those next two stitches and we're going to be holding it to the back, so that means we're going to be holding it behind our regular knitting needles. And then we're going to knit two from the left needles, so we're ignoring that cable needle and we're going to just knit two right here. Okay, now we bring the cable needle out, and we're going to knit from that, knitting two stitches right here. One and two. And now we repeat this pattern between the asterisks all the way down the row. So, let's do it one more time a little bit faster, so we slip the two stitches and we're going to be holding that cable needle with those stitches to the back. Okay, now we're knitting two from our regular knitting needle on the left. So, we're knitting one and two. And then we pick up that cable needle and we are going to knit those two stitches right there! One and two. Alright! So, you are getting the hang of cabling already. This is great! So, on this row, row one, we are finishing with just a simple knit two. No cable needle, just the regular knit two that you are used to doing in all of your other knitting. Okay, row two is purling all the way down the row. And now let's take a look at row three. So, it's very similar, but we start by slipping those two and we hold the cable needle to the front and then we are going to knit two from our left needle. So, one and two from the left needle and then we knit two from our cable needle right here. And between the astericks, we just repeat this pattern all the way down the row. And the last row is a purl row. Okay, so when you have done a series of these rows, this is how it's shaping up! And this is how our work looks on the wrong side, which is also the back side. I hope you are inspired to try this Basket Weave Stitch. It is so beautiful, very impressive. Please like up this video, make sure to SUBSCRIBE so that you don't miss future videos.

0M3Budnl3aI,Nokia 6 Teardown - Build Quality Review - Repair Video,"It’s time to tear down the Nokia 6 and check the build quality, and see how it managed to pass my durability test so well. Depending on what side of the planet you’re on, Nokia could also be pronounced “Nakia”. But either way, let’s get started. [Intro] I’m going to remove the SIM card tray first, like I always do. And then comes the heat gun. If you remember with the Google Pixel how the screen lifted off first, this is going to be almost the same process…which is actually really smart from a design and repair perspective because screens are usually the first thing to break on a phone. I’m taking a thin metal pry tool and sliding it under the glass after the adhesive has been softened and the glass warmed up till just about too hot to touch. I’m placing cards under the glass after it’s lifted so that it won’t re-adhere to the frame again. I’m taking extraordinary care not to touch the LCD edge underneath that glass layer with my metal pry tool or the cards, because that LCD has the structural integrity of a potato chip. You’ll see what I mean in a minute. Normally, anyone attempting this repair will already have a cracked screen and won’t need to salvage or save the old one, but since I like to keep my phones in working condition – for the most part – I’m being careful. Once all the sides have been slit, the screen will lift off just high enough for me to slip one of my playing cards underneath the LCD. Remember, touching the sides of the LCD with anything is catastrophic. It’s extremely easy to break. Most people will not be successful at removing a functional screen on their first try. So if you ever end up replacing anything inside of the phone, just plan on replacing the screen as well. There are some ribbon cables that you need to avoid slicing down here. These can easily be cut with a business card or a metal pry tool so make sure you stay away from them. Avoid the home button and menu buttons too. Lift upward against the glass instead of downward against the metal. And now we start to see what makes this phone so strong. A solid metal mid-plate is protecting the rest of the components. I’m just going to double check and make sure that my screen is still functional. I wouldn’t recommend doing this yourself, it’s better just to leave the phone off the entire time it’s open. Surprisingly enough though, I was successful and my screen is still functioning. So I’ll power down and move onto the connector. There’s one little screw holding down the metal bracket over the screen ribbon connector. I’ll unsnap that just like a little Lego and the screen is off the phone. And this is it. If all you need is a screen replacement, this is literally all you have to do. You don’t need to watch the video any farther. Just grab your new screen, plop it on and you are good to go. It’s really incredibly simple. Remember that the corners and the edge of the LCD are going to be the most fragile. That’s why I was really happy that LG got rid of their corners on the LG G6. It does help with the removal process. An experienced tech who doesn’t need to save the old screen could probably do a whole screen replacement on this Nokia 6 in less than 10 minutes. I’ll link any replacement screens and tools that I find in the video description. There’s one more screw holding down the fingerprint scanner and home button ribbons, so if those stop working, they’re also super easy to replace. I’ll set these off to the side. And this little guy is the battery connector. It would be smart to disconnect this before removing the screen and the home button just so nothing shorts out on accident. I almost missed it because it was so small. And then we find – wait for it – nineteen screws surrounding the middle mid-plate. Some of these are different sizes so it is very important that you keep the screws organized as you remove them. Once the screws are out I’ll slip my pry tool in up near the top ear piece and lift the metal plate up like a giant door. There are some latches at the bottom so this is the best way to go about it. Then we have complete access to the battery. This is a repair guy’s dream by the way. The battery is out and away from all the fragile electronic components now. So if prying needs to happen during the replacement process, nothing important can be broken. But look at this – the Nokia 6 even has those magical pull tabs. There is no prying to be done at all. Just tug the pull tab and the adhesive pulls out away from the battery, leaving it completely loose and free to fall away from the metal plate. No force necessary. I’ll give all the thumbs up to Nokia for this one. If Apple and Samsung don’t step up their game, this phone is going to win the most durable and repairable phone of 2017 easy. The battery is a 3000 milliamp hour. Here’s that metal mid-plate; definitely a huge reason this phone is so rigid. One, it’s made of quality metal and two, when it’s screwed into the thick metal back housing it forms an indestructible metal sandwich. Huawei needs to take a few pointers here from Nokia. There’s one more metal bracket holding down the volume and headphone jack connectors. I’ll set that off to the side. And then 6 more screws are holding down the motherboard to the frame. Keep these organized and away from the mid-plate screws. Then I can unclip the volume ribbon and the headphone jack ribbon. And this is where it starts to get kind of tricky. Now normally, I’m one of the first people in the world to tear down a cell phone for the YouTubes which means I don’t have any guides to follow as I’m doing it. This circuit board pulls straight down and then lifts up out of the frame. During my tinkering I forgot to unclip that bottom left wire cable, so when the board finally lifted off, the head tore off the wire. Incredibly cheap to fix, just kind of annoying that it happened in the first place. So make sure that your wire is unplugged before pulling it out of the board. There’s one more ribbon cable on the bottom as well that leads down to the charging port. Looking at the motherboard, we can see that the two cameras are modular and the LED flash is built into the circuits. If I pop off each of these little cameras we can see that the left one is the rear 16 megapixel camera and the right little guy is the 8 megapixel front facing camera; neither of which have the hardware stabilization. For me, OIS or optical image stabilization is super important. Electronic stabilizing is usually not as good as the hardware stabilizing when it comes to video quality. And since I do a lot with video, it’s kind of a deal breaker for me. I hope Nokia includes it in their future devices. Following this extension ribbon down to the charging port we find 4 more screws. Remove those and unclip the wire cable that we destroyed the other end of, and the micro USB charging port can pull away from the frame. It’s tucked underneath those little metal tabs on the frame just like the motherboard up top was. It also has a little microphone down there at the bottom next to the micro USB port. The loud speaker has its own special section in the frame of the phone. Each metal ridge or lip inside of a metal object add strength to the overall structure. So this Nokia 6 really is utilizing all the available space and design tricks. I’m pretty impressed. This phone also has the same circular vibrator motor we saw in the HTC U Ultra. When putting the circuit board back into place, remember that they slip underneath the metal tabs along the bottom of the frame. I’ll get the 4 screws back in there. And now we can deal with this extension ribbon. It plugs into the bottom of the motherboard so I’ll do that before I set it down into the frame, and when I go to set the motherboard down, it needs to tuck itself into the top of the frame first, under the metal tabs protruding from the frame. I’ve never seen a phone built like such a tank before, but I’m not complaining. These boards definitely aren’t moving anywhere. The volume and power button gets plugged in next as well as the headphone jack ribbon. These both snap into place like a little Lego; you’ll feel it click in. There’s a little metal bracket holding these down as a second layer of protection. Technically you can screw this in place right now if you have your screws organized. Or you can just wait till the back metal panel is in place. There are 6 more screws holding down the motherboard. And don’t forget to plug in that bottom left wire cable either, since mine is broken, I’ll just have to live with it for now until I can get a replacement wire. The battery gets set back into place but not plugged in yet. And finally I can plop that metal mid-frame down into the phone. It has two tabs along the bottom that need to be set into the frame first and then the rest of it can be pushed down. And now we get to sandwich the metal slabs together with nineteen little screws. Overkill? Probably. But durable? Definitely. I’ll slide that home button into the little groove routing that wire over to the plug where it clips in. I’ll tape it back down just to keep it secure. And then finally we get to install the screen. It will clip back in just like the little Lego connections we’ve been working on this whole time. And then when everything is plugged in including the battery, which should be last, we can plop the final two metal brackets into place over the plugs and we’re good to set the screen down into the frame – making sure to line it up over the home button and keep it inside of the grooves on the metal sides. I imagine that the replacement screens will come with their own adhesive which will help keep them down and in place. Overall from a repair perspective, if you have to work on a cell phone that’s glued shut, this is probably the most ideal one to work on. Screens break most often on cell phones and that’s the first component on this device to be removed. Batteries fail most often after that, and this battery is located right below the screen. Pretty easy access for both repairs. I hope the Nokia 6 holds its own on the software and camera size of things because they for sure have the hardware and built quality nailed perfectly.

Hja0SLs2kus,The amazing ways plants defend themselves - Valentin Hammoudi,"This is a tomato plant, and this is an aphid slowly killing the tomato plant by sucking the juice out of its leaves. The tomato is putting up a fight using both physical and chemical defenses to repel the attacking insects. But that's not all. The tomato is also releasing compounds that signal nearby tomato plants to release their own insect repellent. Plants are constantly under attack. They face threats ranging from microscopic fungi and bacteria, small herbivores, like aphids, caterpillars, and grasshoppers, up to large herbivores, like tortoises, koalas, and elephants. All are looking to devour plants to access the plentiful nutrients and water in their leaves, stems, fruits, and seeds. But plants are ready with a whole series of internal and external defenses that make them a much less appealing meal, or even a deadly one. Plants' defenses start at their surface. The bark covering tree trunks is full of lignin, a rigid web of compounds that's tough to chew and highly impermeable to pathogens. Leaves are protected by a waxy cuticle that deters insects and microbes. Some plants go a step further with painful structures to warn would-be predators. Thorns, spines, and prickles discourage bigger herbivores. To deal with smaller pests, some plants' leaves have sharp hair-like structures called trichomes. The kidney bean plant sports tiny hooks to stab the feet of bed bugs and other insects. In some species, trichomes also dispense chemical irritants. Stinging nettles release a mixture of histamine and other toxins that cause pain and inflammation when touched. For other plant species, the pain comes after an herbivore's first bite. Spinach, kiwi fruit, pineapple, fuchsia and rhubarb all produce microscopic needle-shaped crystals called raphides. They can cause tiny wounds in the inside of animals' mouths, which create entry points for toxins. The mimosa plant has a strategy designed to prevent herbivores from taking a bite at all. Specialized mechanoreceptor cells detect touch and shoot an electrical signal through the leaflet to its base causing cells there to release charged particles. The buildup of charge draws water out of these cells and they shrivel, pulling the leaflet closed. The folding movement scares insects away and the shrunken leaves look less appealing to larger animals. If these external defenses are breached, the plant immune system springs into action. Plants don't have a separate immune system like animals. Instead, every cell has the ability to detect and defend against invaders. Specialized receptors can recognize molecules that signal the presence of dangerous microbes or insects. In response, the immune system initiates a battery of defensive maneuvers. To prevent more pathogens from making their way inside, the waxy cuticle thickens and cell walls get stronger. Guard cells seal up pores in the leaves. And if microbes are devouring one section of the plant, those cells can self-destruct to quarantine the infection. Compounds toxic to microbes and insects are also produced, often tailor-made for a specific threat. Many of the plant molecules that humans have adopted as drugs, medicines and seasonings evolved as part of plants' immune systems because they're antimicrobial, or insecticidal. An area of a plant under attack can alert other regions using hormones, airborne compounds, or even electrical signals. When other parts of the plant detect these signals, they ramp up production of defensive compounds. And for some species, like tomatoes, this early warning system also alerts their neighbors. Some plants can even recruit allies to adopt a strong offense against their would-be attackers. Cotton plants under siege by caterpillars release a specific cocktail of ten to twelve chemicals into the air. This mixture attracts parasitic wasps that lay eggs inside the caterpillars. Plants may not be able to flee the scene of an attack, or fight off predators with teeth and claws, but with sturdy armor, a well-stocked chemical arsenal, a neighborhood watch, and cross-species alliances, a plant isn't always an easy meal.",Food and Entertaining,Drinks,Make Nettle Spray for Aphids,True,4107,en,en

vdCAWFC80JQ,EXPERIMENT Giant Orbeez Water Balloon Tested to the MAX! Will it Pop?,"- [Carl] Bag number seven, eight. Whoa it feels really cool though. Okay, I don't know what's gonna happen. Ready? - Yeah! (Upbeat Music) - [Carl] The kids have built a giant fort-- a blanket fort in the living room. I don't even think there's anybody in there. Anybody in there? Nobody's in there--oh Tag's in there. (Carl Laughs) You found the best spot didn't you? You silly dog. More Christmas packages have arrived. This one, I believe, (Package rattling) (Gasp) It is. It's a whole box full of Orbeez. I'm wearing my Santa Clause sweatshirt and my pajamas and you know what? I was really sick yesterday, so I don't care. But we have a Wubble and we have these giant balloons and all those Orbeez. I saw this video clip with a youtube channel, CrazyRussianHacker, and he put some of these in a normal size balloon and filled it up with water and it was really cool, so we wanna try and take it to the next level and do a giant balloon, or a Wubble, with a whole bunch of Orbeez and see what happens. So I'm not even sure the best way to approach this, so I say we just grab the funnel and get one of these balloons. Let's come over by the sink here and go for it. - We're doing the clear one first. - [Carl] We're gonna do the see-through one because that way we can see all the different jelly beads-- Orbeez inside there. Alright. Do we even need the funnel you think? That's a pretty big balloon. - No! Maybe, I don't know, - Yeah, I don't know, - Maybe just in case - [Carl] Let's just fill it up - Yeah! - [Carl] Let's go. - [Kyle] There it goes - [Carl] You can totally see them down inside there. - [Kyle] Oh no! - [Carl] We better use the funnel - Yeah, that's a better idea. - [Carl] Let's Learn, Right? Learn from our mistakes. - Mhm - Here we go! - Go! - [Carl] There we go - That's cool. - [Carl] Okay Kyle, you grab the next bag. Dump it in there. - That is cool. - Whoa - We have a little cloggage - Uh oh - [Carl] You've got a traffic jam. (Carl laughs) Can you get it? Don't poke a whole in the balloon. You gotta be really careful. Here, we'll go like this down in the top. See if we can get it cleared out. We going? We got it. It's going again. Cool. Four bags? - Yeah - [Carl] Do you think that's enough? - Yeah! - Yeah - [Carl] You think that's pretty cool-- I don't know. We'd wanna make a huge one full of water though - Hmm (Carl Laughs) - Maybe five or six. That would be good. - Let's put six. We can always order more Orbeez right? Let's just fill this thing up. Let's just do all 10 bags of Orbeez right? - Yeah - Yeah - [Carl] We're just gonna put all 10 in there. If we're gonna do it, go big or go home right? - Yeah - Yeah (Carl Laughs) - [Carl] What is this? This one is - Seven - Seven - [Carl] Bag number seven. Eight. Bags nine and 10. - We might have to take this into the bathtub. - [Carl] Man, I don't know. Okay. That's it - Oh no - Ten bags of Orbeez - Look at that! Oh my gosh. - [Kyle] It's filled up It's stuck - It's filled up all the way - Oh my gosh - [Carl] Up the neck and everything - It's gonna start over-- - [Carl] No, we 'll fix it here just don't worry about it We'll get it. We'll get it. - Okay okay - [Carl] Ten bags of Orbeez in one giant balloon. Look at that. Let go Kyle. Look at that. It's heavy, it's really heavy. Should we just fill it up in the sink here? - Yeah - Yeah, let's do that - [Carl] Okay Those Orbeez look thirsty. There we go! - Wow - [Carl] That looks crazy - It's already getting so big - I know - [Carl] Do not let go - [Gauge] Will you adjust my hand so I can grab onto it really tight? - [Carl] That's crazy. - Hopefully it doesn't explode - [Carl] I know we gotta be careful huh? - Yeah - [Carl] Wow check that out. All of the Orbeez are clumped together. Look, I'm gonna bump them. Oh it's formed a hard lump. - [Gauge] Weird - what the? (balloon wobbling) [Kyle] Whoa! I touched it - [Carl] That is really weird yeah? Look it's like there's a whole big lump of Orbeez all stuck together right in the middle that you can see in there. - [Gauge] That is really, really weird - [Carl] Isn't that weird? - Yeah - Yeah - [Carl] They all clumped together with the water. We switched over to the spray nozzle. I was tempted to try and take it out of the sink to get a good picture of it, but I think we're committed at this point. (Carl Laughs) - What is going on in here? - [Carl] We have - mommy! - [Carl] Ten packs of Orbeez in a giant-- - This looks like a giant mess. - [Carl] It is going to be a giant mess. - Oh my gosh (Carl laughs) - [Carl} Ten Packs Of Orbeez-- every single package that we ordered is in that giant water balloon right now. - What are we gonna do with it? - [Carl] I don't know, we're gonna-- (Laughter) We're gonna tie it off, and let them swell up and then we're gonna cut the top off and see what happens. (Carl laughs) - [Gauge] Hilarious - [Carl] We're gonna create a giant waterfall that's gonna spray Orbeez into the air everywhere. Ginger decided I can't make big messes in the kitchen. - Putting my foot down - So we're gonna put a towel underneath it. And so we can get it out of the sink once it's tied off and swollen up and we can take it outside in order to cut the top off. Bummer. - Carl, you need to have better plans. - [Carl] I never have plans that's what makes it so exciting. - (Gasp) Oh my goodness - (laughter) - [Carl] We can get in under there. I just gotta put the camera down and help you I think or we'll give it over to Gauge and let him film. - Okay your job is to (whistle) the towel underneath the balloon - I have to (whistle) - You know what I'm sayin? ( whistle) (Gauge laughs) - Oh - See? We're out, we got it. Look at that. - Teamwork! (laughing) teamwork. - We got it. See now we can get it out of the sink and take it outside once it's swollen up. Once it's all swole up! - [Carl] (laughing) - It's so interesting We've had this thing filling up and absorbing the water all day. We're gonna wait until morning and take it out onto the trampoline I think, but look at it now. It's filling up the entire sink, and bulging out over the top. It's gonna be a struggle to get it out of the house I think. - That is really crazy. - Alright, here we go. - Oh my gosh that's so heavy! - Oh that was actually a lot easier than I thought. - Well I think it's really heavy (laughing) - Really? Okay - Okay, are you ready? - Yeah, now we have to be really careful not to spill this thing out on the ground. We're gonna move it out to the trampoline outside so we can get the Orbeez shooting up into the air everywhere as we pop the balloon. Here we go. Oh towel, please don't rip open. - Oh that would be so bad! - please don't rip (grunt) - Ow! - Oh! Here we go. - Ready? One, two, three! - That is so heavy. Alright, let's get the towel out from underneath it. - It's like a huge-- - Whoa weird! Look! It's all milky on the bottom. - That is weird - That is weird - Oh it's just the color of the balloon. - Oh, right that didn't get stretched? So we have more room in there. I wonder if we can hook the hose up and fill it up more. Let's do it. The weather is just warm enough today that there's no ice in the hose, so we can actually top this thing off out here on the trampoline. There's a little hole in the neck, - Oh no! so be really careful of that. See that hole? - Yeah. - [Kyle] Whoa - [Gauge] Look at it go. - [Carl] Well that is filling up a lot faster now out here with the hose. Maybe let some of the air out. See if you open up the neck a little bit. (blowing air) That's cool, huh? See if you look up closely, some of the Orbeez haven't even gotten access to water, all the way yet and some of them are really small while some are a lot bigger. So if we really let this balloon fill up with water a lot more, than we can get this thing quite a bit bigger even. - So in each individual packet of Orbeez, there's approximately 20,000 beads. And we put 10 packets in there so, you do the math. It's a lot. We've hit maximum capacity so I'm actually just gonna tie this thing off now finally. No more twisty-ties. It's gonna be permanent now. I'm just afraid this thing is gonna explode at any second! Got it! It's time to unleash the Orbeez, are you ready? - Yeah! - Yeah - Okay. I don't know what's gonna happen! Ready? - Yeah - Yeah [Family] Whoa! - Look at it! - Orbeez! - [Carl] Holy smokes! Look at that. - Look at the balloon! It's just-- - [Carl] I thought it was gonna shoot clear up in the air but it literally just exploded everywhere. (Balloon Pops) - What? - Whoa! - [Carl] That was crazy! - That's so cool (Kyle Laughs) - [Carl] That's a ton of them, huh? - [Children] Yeah! - [Carl] Someone should get on the trampoline and jump around with them. (Carl Laughs) That's cool. Don't fall down in them. Whatever you do-- oh Kyle! (carl Laughs) (Kyle yelling) Did they get down inside your boots? (Carl laughs) Alright guys, thanks so much for hanging out with our family. Merry Christmas to everyone and happy holidays. Click any of the links anywhere on the screen in order to subscribe and watch more videos. And we will see you guys next time. [Children] Bye! You know what we're gonna do? We're gonna come back in a couple of days and we're gonna see if the Orbeez freeze solid on the trampoline into a giant slab of Orbeez So, to be continued.",Hobbies and Crafts,Crafts,Make an Orbeez Stress Ball,True,9311,en,en

AxOI_A55PO4,How to make a Rag Rug using T-shirts - Tshirt rug tutorial,"Winter is coming here, and when I get out my bed I would like to put my feet on a little rug. Sooo.. let's make one. We need a cardboard. A bit bigger then the size of the rug you want to make. Then on 2 of the sides we place a mark every 1 cm or 0,5 inch. At the place of our marks we make little cuts with the scissor. Then we attach a yarn to the cardboard. I go one time around a make a little knot. So it stays in place. Then with the yarn we follow all the cuts we made. And we tie the last string with another knot. So it stays also in place. It will look something like this. Now we get our old shirts and we cut it into strips or one big yarn like I do here. For this rug I use 4 shirts and 4 different colors. Now we can start weaving the strips into the cardboard. I alternate the strips like I show you here. Now fill it all the way up and it looks something like this. Then with a needle a thread I sew the sides together. So it won't come loose. Now we can remove the rug from the cardboard. The last thing to do is cut the sides with a scissor. To give it a clean look. That's it.

RvuiJT_j_lE,Peanut Butter Brownie Bowl From Scratch For Sundae | Birthday Video | Cait Straight Up,"Hey guys my name is Caitlin and welcome back to Cait Straight Up. Its my birthday! Go shorty its my birthday! Scares me every time. Woo. I am turning 28 today, cheer to that I mean right you know, ugh ugh its so painful. But I am going to sooth that pain of almost being 30 with a delicious peanut butter brownie bowl that I am going to throw some vanilla ice cream in and some chocolate chips a little bit of sprinkles and a cherry and I am going to have a delicious desert here for my self. So today's recipe guys a peanut butter brownie bowl for a Sunday and for this girls birthday. Woo! So this birthday girl believe it or not, I don't really crave sweets, now put a cheese platter in front of me and I can be dangerous, but two things that I could never turn down though are probably my favorite, brownies peanut butter and vanilla ice cream. I guess thats three not two but apparently I have three weaknesses. Without further adieu, lets get started so in our mixing bowl here we have 1/4 of a tea spoon of baking powder and 1/4 of a tea spoon of salt. We are going to add two eggs beaten and then we are going to add half a cup of regular sugar and then half a cup of brown sugar, after that half a cup again of just some regular old flower and this time a third of a cup of unsweetened coco powder, now we are adding half a cup of melted butter and half a cup of some peanut butter that I just softened a little bit in the microwave. Doesn't have to be completely melted, just a little bit soft and I am using creamy here because that is my favorite, I can't stand that chunky crap. Last but not least a tea spoon of vanilla, just going to dump that right in and we are going to give this all a nice mix. We are just going to mix this all together, till its nice and smooth and blended and then we are going to get out our muffin tins. So we are just going to give this a nice spray so our brownie bowls pop out nice and easy. So we are just going to start spooning our brownie batter in and we are going to fill our muffin tin about half around each little circular hole in here. You can always go back if any are a little bit uneven and just add in some extra batter. I like to go through the whole thing first just to make sure that I can get through the tray. Now this stuff is arguably the most important we have to really really spray this side of our tin because we are just going to dunk it on in there and we are gonna have to pull it out nice and easily. So really really give your pan here a nice hefty spray and make sure you get all corners of the muffin tin. We preheated out oven to 350 degrees and it is time to dunk on down into our batter. So you are just going to try and press, nice and evenly, little bit firmly the top tin down into your brownie batter and into the oven they go for 30 minutes. So after 30 minutes we got these awesome looking brownie bowls and I am going to add some chocolate chips and some sprinkles right to the top because its my birthday. I am going to top it all off with a cherry and Happy Birthday to me! If you have any questions about this brownie bowl comment below, of course subscribe guys its my birthday, its my birthday wish it will make me so happy and any other questions or anything like that go ahead and tweet at me @CaitStaightUp and guys I can't wait to see you next time, hopefully we have a fun year of me being 28 here on Cait Straight Up.

tH-PaNugz9w,"How To Turn Styrofoam, Into Solid Aluminum","For this video, I’m going to show you how to convert something made of styrofoam, into something made of solid aluminum, using common play sand, and a little bit of magic. Start with some foam board from the dollar store and peel the paper layers off the top and the bottom. Now draw, or print a picture of whatever it is you want to make, and use your pictures as a guide, to cut the foam board into individual pieces. I cut and glued my pieces together, to make an awesome looking styrofoam pistol. It looks pretty cool like this, but to turn the styrofoam into metal, we’re going to need some play sand. We’ll also need to fire up the mini metal foundry we built in a previous project, and start liquefying a few of the metal biscuits we made from recycled soda cans. With that warming up, let’s go ahead and pour a bit of sand into a 5 gallon bucket until it’s at least 2” to 3” deep. Now take your styrofoam creation, and glue a thick foam riser somewhere on the side, then push the whole thing into the sand so it stands upright. If we sprinkle a bunch more sand around the styrofoam mold, it should hold it firmly in place, and as you’re adding the sand, make sure the foam riser is poking up out of the center. That’s really important. Now, when the sand covers everything completely, give the bucket a little shake to level it out and fill any gaps around the styrofoam underneath. It’s a good idea to have a little spray bottle handy so you can spritz some water and moisten the top layer of the sand. This way you’ll be able to build a volcano, around the foam riser, to act as a funnel leading down to the styrofoam. Now here’s where the magic begins to happen. When we pour molten aluminum into the makeshift funnel, the foam at the bottom vaporizes in an instant, and the liquid aluminum rushes in to take it’s place. You can see it all happens very quickly, so be sure you’re pouring fast enough to keep the funnel full, but slow enough to stop when it’s done. Let everything cool for around 10 minutes, and the metal should be hard enough to grip onto with a pair of pliers. So pull it up out of the sand, and you’ll see your styrofoam creation has just transformed into solid aluminum, almost like magic. If you want to make it look nicer, you can clean up the rough edges with a file and some sand paper, and that’s how simple it is to make anything you can think of, into solid metal. By the way, this also works with housing insulation as well. I put a pink foam sword into the sand, and 10 minutes later pulled out an identical copy cast in solid aluminum. Well that’s it for now.

fldGvBEucCQ,"DIY Fashion Kimono, Gatsby Style - Threadbanger","Hello people of the Internet. This is the part of your brain that likes to make garments from scratch. What have you done for me lately? What's up Thread-heads? You asked for it, so I'm giving it to you. There's been a ton of requests for both a kimono tutorial and a death-level project. So I present to you the kimono of death. If you are an experienced sewer, you may not consider this a death project, but I've rated it as such for the amount of time it takes and the amount of steps involved with completing the garment. You also may want to have a basic understanding of sewing and pattern making, but don't fret if you don't. You should check out my custom skirt course that I did over on Craftovision. There's a bunch of information about how to draft patterns and transfer them onto fabric and also sewing them together. So I would definitely check that out first. Now you may be saying to yourself, ""This isn't a traditional kimono. This is a kimo-no, a kimo-not."" And you're right. If you want a traditional kimono, I suggest you either buy one from a Japanese kimono maker or you study under a Japanese kimono maker on how to make your own. This one that I'm going to show you how to make is more fashion inspired. it really invokes the spirit of the 1920s but also can be super casual when paired with a pair of cutoff shorts and a cut-up shirt. The possibilities are endless. All right, down to business. The first thing you need to do is take some measurements and map out your pattern pieces. We're going to start with the back pattern piece. First take your back length measurement starting at the base of the neck extending to whatever length you want plus an inch for seam allowance. On your map, this measurement will be points A to B, and this will be the center back line of your garment. Now measure from the back base of the neck to the side of your neck. This will be point C. Point C lies 2 inches above point A and out the amount you measured plus an inch for seam allowance. This line should also be rounded slightly. Next measure from the side of the neck to the shoulder. This will be point D. Point D lies about 2 inches down from point C and out the amount you measured plus an inch for seam allowance. Now measure half of your arm hole. Line D to E is going to be your arm hole, so you want to add 3 to 4 inches to your measurement for ease and seam allowance. For that kimono style, you want the sleeves to be kind of wide. Lastly, point F extends about 3 inches beyond the existing width of the garment. And that's going to be the bottom width of your garment. When you connect all your lines, you should have something like this. We're going to use this graph to also map out the front pattern. All you have to do is measure 1 inch in from point B and make a mark, then measure down 2 inches from point A and in 1 inch and make a mark. Then connect those two points. This new line is going to be the front opening of your garment. Now connect these two points to create the front neckline, and this line should also be slightly rounded. And voila, those are the only differences in the pattern. The rest will stay the same. For the sleeve pattern, use the same measurement you used for points D and E on the previous pattern. Then measure out the length of your arm from point D, make a mark, and connect these points. Measure down about 12 inches from point F, make a mark, and connect point F to point G. This will be the cuff of your garment. Now connect points G and E and you have your sleeve all mapped out. Now you're going to use your guides to make three pattern pieces on paper, the back pattern piece, the front pattern piece, and the sleeve pattern piece. Starting with the back pattern piece, get out some fabric, fold the fabric in just enough to fit the pattern making sure the fabric is right sides together. Then place the center back line of the pattern onto the fold and pin the pattern to both layers of fabric. Now cut around your pattern making sure not to cut the fold of the fabric. And you don't have to worry about seam allowance because you already added it into the pattern. When you're done cutting, you should have a piece that looks like this. Now you just do the same for the front pattern piece. The only difference is that you cut along the center front line creating two front pieces. For the sleeves, fold a piece of fabric right sides together, then place the top edge of the pattern along the fold, pin, and cut it out. Repeat for a second sleeve. And now that you have all your pieces cut, you're going to pin and sew them together at these points leaving a half inch seam allowance. Once all those pieces are sewn, you're going to trim all the seams with pinking shears. Next press each seam with your iron to make your new stitches happy in their new home. Then press the seam open like so. Now do a double turn quarter-inch hem for all the edges except the arm holes. For the sleeves or any other rounded edges, it really helps to have a tailor's hand. Have you seen these and wondered what they are? Well, they are an amazing tool and I suggest you get one. Once all your seams are finished, it's time to add some fringe. You may recognize this fringe from this video I did a while back. I have a ton left over, and you only need about a yard and a half for this project. Starting with the sleeves, pin fringe to the inside of the hem like so, then sew it on following the stitch line you created sewing your hem. You're also going to want to press that stitch line as well. Next pin your sleeve to your arm hole right sides together and sew together leaving a half inch seam allowance. Repeat for the other sleeve, and make sure to finish and press that seam as well. Now just add fringe down both sides of the front opening, and you are done. You can style this Gatsby style with long necklaces and cloche hat or gypsy junkie style with a cut tee, cutoff shorts, and my DIY personal pendant. And here's a creepy shot to show the arms in action. I am in love with this garment. I plan on making one in all black also because I'm kind of obsessed with wearing black, in case you can't tell. Yeah. I really hope you enjoyed this project. If you have any questions at all, leave a comment below and I will do my best to answer them.

xfRHAS1lriw,5 Quick Tips to Paint a Bathroom with The Idaho Painter -- by Home Repair Tutor,"So here’s today’s question: How do you paint a bathroom? Well, there’s no better way to learn than from a professional. So I’ve got an awesome surprise for you today. Chris Berry, The Idaho Painter, is going to show you all of his tips and tricks on how to paint a bathroom quickly, efficiently, and professionally. So I’m partnering with Chris on this video. You’re going to love it. He does awesome YouTube videos. You can check him out over on YouTube at the Idaho Painter. But let’s dive into his tutorial right now. This is Chris, The Idaho Painter. Glad to be here on the Home Repair Tutor to give you five tips and tricks to painting a bathroom to make it just like a professional painter did it. So stay tuned for this video. So I’m here in this small bathroom right here. And painting a bathroom doesn’t have to be this really long, draw-out process where it takes a day or multiple days to do. A bathroom like this can easily be done in just a couple of hours. But one of the key elements to painting a bathroom and making it look like a professional painter did it is actually have tools that a professional painter would have. Now I’m going to give you a list of the tools and some of the items that you’re going to need to get this project done. So this is tip #1 when it comes to painting a bathroom, and that’s actually having a paintbrush and a paint roller that’s actually going to give you quality results. And if you’re trying to save money and go cheap on a paintbrush and a roller, you’re just not going to get those straight cut-in lines, you’re not going to get the quality finish on the walls, and it’s just going to take you a lot longer to apply the paint. Typically when I’m painting interiors, I like using an interior brush that’s a 3-inch angled sash brush. I like a wider brush because I can paint a lot faster with it. A good quality brush is going to give you nice, crisp, clean cut-in lines. It’s going to hold a lot more paint, and you’re going to be able to go a lot farther. So you’re going to paint a lot faster with it. The brush that I typically use on interiors when I’m painting interior walls and doing cut-ins, I like a Purdy brush. It’s called a ClearCut brush. And this is the actual brush I use. That brush is really good for doing cut-ins. It’s really good for doing the layouts on your walls and edges. Doesn’t leave a whole lot of roping. It’s an excellent brush. The next thing is your roller. You got to have a quality roller. And when I’m rolling the walls, I use a 3/8-inch nap—that’s the depth of the roller. So use a 3/8-inch nap, and I like the white woven rollers from Purdy. Now if you go cheap on a roller, the first thing that you’ll notice when you start rolling on the walls, it leaves a lint on the walls which just doesn’t look good. The lint—that’s actually the fuzzy stuff on the rollers. So cheap rollers leave the lint on. Cheap rollers will have the tendency to splatter, so you’re going to get a lot more mess on your floors. Use a high quality roller and you’re going to get a lot less splatters or almost none. The rollers we use—I use a Purdy WhiteDove white woven roller. And that roller’s excellent. It hardly ever leaves any amount of splatters, and it also holds more paint and lays the paint out a lot better. And it doesn’t leave very much stippling. A cheap roller or cheap nap is going to stipple your walls really bad, and you’re not going to get that good quality finish. So tip #1 is buy a good quality paintbrush and a good quality roller. But now you got your tools all gathered together. Got to get your good quality paint for a bathroom, depending on the condition of your bathroom whether it has moisture issues or not. You definitely want to look into paint. Jeff is going to be doing a video on my channel of how to select the paint for a bathroom. So if you want to come check out Jeff’s video on my channel, The Idaho Painter, you can also come check it out. Can’t wait to see his video on selecting bathroom paints. So tip #2, I got all my tools gathered together. Tip #1 was buy a good quality paintbrush, good quality roller. Tip #2 is buying a high quality tape. And the best tape that I’ve ever found for doing my cut-ins—around edges, around door jams, around my baseboards, all my trim—the best tape that I found is FrogTape. You want to get a tape that the paint’s not going to bleed through to give you edges where the paint’s bleeding through on your trim. FrogTape is the very best. I’ve used every tape out there in the market. There’s nothing better than FrogTape. But I also use clear caulking along with my Frogtape which will actually give you just laser straight lines on all your trim—around your door jams, your baseboards, window trim, around stuff like your showers and bathtubs and stuff like that. So tip #2 is get yourself FrogTape. I don’t use anything but just 1-inch FrogTape. I do get a lot of questions, too, about how you go about using the FrogTape and clear caulking. I do have a video that explains that in depth, too. It’s a really good video on how to use caulking and FrogTape to make laser straight lines on a wall, like if you’re painting the stripe or something like that. So you can check that out later, too. But we’re going to move on to tip #3 now. So tip #3 is actually getting into the managing of this project and actually getting it done in two ours. And tip #3 is once you get all your masking done, you want to get a first coat on these walls so this first coat will begin drying. And that first coat, you don’t want it to be heavy like you’re trying to cover it in one go. Typically when we’re painting and rolling interior walls, we always figure on putting two coats. And our first coat is what we call a skim coat. So we’re going to roll on here a light coat on there enough to just get a nice good thin coat on the walls, and then that will dry in about 30 minutes. So tip #4 is part of the next process. We’ve rolled our first coat on the walls, that’s tip #3. Get that first coat on there. A skim coat. Get that stuff on there. Nice and thin so it’ll dry fast. Turn on your fan; that will suck out some of the extra moisture in your bathroom that the paint is actually creating because the humidity is actually going to slow down the drying time. Crank up the temperature in your house. Get it up to about 75°. That will help it dry fast. But tip #4 is actually doing your ceiling cut-ins. Now I’m going to go around and do my ceiling cut-ins. And I’m going to do them and try to do my ceiling cut-ins so they will cover in one coat. So I’m going to put them on there pretty heavy. I’m going to cut in and then I’m going to back roll it with my 4-inch roller that’s in my bucket. Get those all done. It’s a small bathroom, I could do the cut-ins in here in about 15 minutes, and then I’m going to move on to the next process. Now I’m going to move on to tip #5. This is the last tip, and this is doing your cut-ins and rolling your final coat. So you’ve done your ceiling cut-ins now. And now we’re going to want to move down to doing cut-ins along all your trim, wherever your 1-inch tape is. You’re going to cut all that in and then roll your second coat over the top, overlapping those edges. So you’re keeping a wet edge. You’re going to roll all that, and then you’re going to pull off all your masking. So I’m going to run around, put my clear caulking on all my tape, then I’m going to cut my cut-ins in with my paint, and then I’m going to go back and roll the walls and fill in the walls. So the process is going to be: I’m going to run my clear caulking all around all my edges. That will only take about 5 minutes or less. Then I’m going to do my cut-ins with my brush and my roller around all these edges, which will probably take me about 10-15 minutes to do the cut-ins. And then I’m going to begin rolling my second coat on my walls, and the second coat’s going to happen really fast in here. There’s not a lot of walls. It’ll probably take another 10 minutes. And then I’m going to just pull off all my tape. You want to make sure you pull off that tape before the paint or the caulking dries. The caulking’s going to dry slower than the paint because it’s underneath the paint, which is you’ll put a wet film over the top of the caulking. So then once you’ve rolled the final coat on the walls, you’re going to immediately go back, pull all that tape off, then let your walls dry, let all your cut-ins dry. Then you just go back typically on your cut-ins because you’re trying to do this all in one coat. You might have some blind spots. I just go back, do all those touch-ups on my cut-ins. You see the walls, there’s going to be—you have nothing more you’ll have to do the walls because you got two coats on the walls. And your project’s all done. Check it out once it’s all done. Should look like a professional painter just did it. Once again, if that caulking process, what I’ve explained here, if it’s a little bit difficult or a little confusing, go check out my channel, The Idaho Painter. I do have a video explaining in depth this caulking and taping process and exactly how you go about doing it. But it’s a very important process if you really want those laser straight lines. If you’ve ever wondered how a painter got laser straight lines on all of this trim and stuff, that’s exactly one of the tips and tricks out there that a lot of Do-It-Yourselfers don’t know about. So there you have it. There’s five tips and tricks on painting a bathroom and getting that done in a reasonable amount of time. Shouldn’t take you a whole day. If you’re a first timer, a bathroom like this, you can literally get done in less than a half a day. Should take you two to three hours. Hopefully these tips and tricks will help you. If you don’t know how to properly roll a wall or do a cut-in, I got a lot of videos on that’ll teach you how to cut-in just like a professional painter. Well, I’ve got probably five or six videos. I even got a video with a GoPro stuck to a paintbrush so you can see exactly what I’m doing. Also got videos on how to properly roll and layout a wall. That’s going to make your finish look a lot better. Hopefully you’ve enjoyed this video. I’m glad to be here on the Home Repair Tutor. If you haven’t subscribed to Jeff’s channel, please subscribe to his channel. Consider going over to my channel, The Idaho Painter, and check out some of my videos. I got all kinds of videos on interior and exterior painting and home improvement tips and tricks.

hbsNoHnYKSU,Fail-Safe Stuffing with Pork & Sage | Jamie Oliver,"Hello lovely people, ok stuffing, mastering the perfect stuffing, I wanna give you principles that you can use to give your consistency, gorgeousness, deliciousness, breadcrumbs onions sage there's dried fruit there's nuts I want you to put your own stamp on your stuff first up the three basics that you must have, onions, bread, herb ok this will give you a basic stuffing and the way you take it to the next level is by using beautiful minced pork shoulder really really nice good delicious fat and then over here you got the embellishments things like lovely chestnuts whether they're from a vacuum pack or whether they're roasted over a fire, gorgeous and peeled we've got like all those lovely christmasy kind of nuts that you'd get just toasted up and cracked, they're beautiful really good then dried fruit just a tiny bit of surprise sweetness and sourness, dried cranberries, apricot very good then a little bit of dry chili just to give it a background kind of hum now I don't want it to be hot, nutmeg which is a classic and a little cinnamon let's go in with a little olive oil and a little knob of butter what we want to do is start to fry off the fragrant things like the sage this is going to be enough for this whole dish plus a nice kind of 500 gram ball that'll go up the back of the turkey or in the chicken or in your sort of roast pork, slice it through the leaves get rid of these stalks go in with about 2 tablespoons of olive oil, butter a little chili, pinch of cinnamon, and then nutmeg now the reason for this is you're waking up all those spices half the nutmeg goes in we can turn the heat up ok the first thing that's gonna happen, spicy oily buttery fat in there the sage goes in and we're got that on a medium heat just finely chop 2 or 3 onions the onions will go lovely and sweet, so onions into the sage beautiful ok you don't have to make them super sweet or caramelised just soften them up and give them a shake around again, y'know meat's always been expensive so the point of a stuffing was to add flavour make it exciting have different textures but also stretch a little meat a long way we'll lightly season with salt pepper so guys turn this off now and let that cool down so you can put this in a kind of dish now, give it 5-10 minutes get it nice and cool now if you look at the 1 1/2 kilos of pork shoulder, let's put this into a bowl that's gonna be enough to put half a kilo up the back off your turkey or even chicken or y'know rubbed across the pork loin before you roll it up and then you can have a kilo to make nice and crispy, you want 2 or 3 big handfuls of bread to kind of stretch the meat a lot further we've got chestnuts here, so these are vacuum packed chestnut guys you can get these in the supermarkets but you could use other nuts as well you can kind of just bust some up in your hand leave a couple whole like that, things like apricots are just gorgeous and then things like the dried cranberries totally cool, not much just a few, and with the apricots we'll just run our knife through it then we'll put it in so when your onions are fully cooled down add them to your bowl and mix it up, scrunch it in your hands, of course you can use a spoon if you want to but to be honest it's much better to get stuck in if that's just minced pork shoulder then you will need to season good couple of pinches of salt and pepper when you work it with your hands like this it just makes it bind nicely so what I like to do now is take about 500 grams of this stuffing, it's about 1/3 of it and I'll put this into a dish like that and this I will stuff in the turkey, I'll only stuff it in the neck, that little flap of skin you can stuff it underneath don't put it in the carcass cos' that's gonna slow down the cooking but that will be kind of blonde and juicy it will flavour the meat, the meat will flavour it, and it will flavour the tray that will flavour your gravy, you see where we're going so now with this nice big old chunk here add this to the tray here and then what I love to do is just push it right into the edges when it cooks it does shrink a little bit so you can kind of push the stuffing up the edge, just gonna wash my hands just take a few little leaves on the top, you can mix it up, have a blend, bits of chestnut and a few cranberries y'know cos' you're kind of story telling on the top and I just think it's really exciting and then a tiny bit of olive oil just so that sage goes from being dry and horrible and it'll go crispy and gorgeous, just pat your little sage leaves just look at the colour you can imagine the flavour can't you, this will be amazing I have a stuffing that's cooked already, gnarly crispy, gorgeous, have a little try mm so good if you want any inspiration to go with this stuffing then hit the link up here we've got gravy we've got the perfect roast potatoes, we've got the perfect roast turkey, how to carve it, all sorts of ideas up here and down in the description box we've got loads of inspiration from JamieOliver.com, until next time good luck take care lots of love from me Mr. O!",Food and

3PIS6EMwtCE,How to Get Rid of Plaque  - Home Remedies for Plaque and Tartar,"How to Naturally Remove Plaque and Tartar from Teeth Plaque is a sticky, soft film of bacteria that builds up on your teeth, dental fillings, gums, tongue, dentures and crowns. When multiple layers of plaque combine with minerals present in your saliva, it hardens into a white, chalky calcified substance called tartar. It create a breeding ground for the oral bacteria that feed on sugars from the food you eat. In addition, it forms acid during this process that breaks down the tooth enamel, leading to dental cavities. Bacteria also produce toxins causing various periodontal problems. Several factors contribute to plaque buildup, such as improper oral hygiene, bad brushing technique, poor food choices, heredity and lack of professional care. Once the tartar has mineralized on your teeth, it is extremely difficult to remove. Maintaining dental hygiene is key to preventing plaque and tartar buildup. In addition to regular dental hygiene, you can use some natural remedies to remove plaque and tartar. 1. Oil Pulling Oil pulling is an age-old practice that supports oral health and helps remove plaque from teeth. Extra-virgin coconut oil is great for oil pulling because it is high in lauric acid that has anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. Swish 1 tablespoon of extra-virgin coconut oil around in your mouth for 15 to 20 minutes. Spit it out. Do not gargle with it or swallow it. Brush your teeth as usual. Repeat daily, in the morning before eating anything. 2. Baking Soda Baking soda, also called sodium bicarbonate, is a great home remedy for removing plaque. It neutralizes acids in the mouth, thereby reducing the amount of harmful bacteria. It also helps whiten and brighten your pearly whites. Put a small amount of baking soda on the bristles of your wet toothbrush and brush your teeth with it. Rinse your mouth and teeth thoroughly with lukewarm water. Alternatively, mix 1 teaspoon of salt with 2 teaspoons of baking soda. Dip a dampened toothbrush in the mixture. Brush your teeth with this powder gently. Another option is to mix 1 teaspoon of baking soda with enough hydrogen peroxide to make a paste. Use it to brush your teeth and gums, spit it out and rinse your mouth thoroughly. Do not use baking soda in excess as it may damage the tooth enamel over time. 3. Guava Both guava fruit and leaves are considered excellent antiplaque agents to help remove plaque accumulated on the teeth and gums. Wash some tender guava leaves and chew them thoroughly, then spit them out. Do this daily to reduce the risk of plaque formation on the teeth. Take a piece of unripe guava, sprinkle salt on it and chew it slowly. Do this 1 to 2 times daily for a few days. 4. Aloe Vera Aloe vera is effective at dealing with gum disease caused by plaque and tartar. Being an antimicrobial, it kills the bacteria that cause plaque buildup. Plus, it fights bad breath. Slit an aloe vera leaf and extract the pulp. Rub the pulp directly on your teeth and gum line. Leave it on for 10 minutes, then rinse it off with cold water. Use this remedy twice daily. 5.Cloves Ground cloves have been widely used for ages as a home remedy to relieve toothaches. It can also be used to fight microbes in your mouth that may cause plaque and tartar. Mix 1 teaspoon of powdered cloves and a little olive oil. Apply this mixture on your teeth. Wait a few minutes, then rinse it off with lukewarm water. Do this twice a day. Also, chew 1 or 2 cloves on a regular basis to support oral health and reduce bad breath caused by the bacteria in your mouth. 6. White Vinegar White vinegar contains acetic acid that can help prevent demineralization of enamel as well as prevent and reduce accumulation of plaque. It also has antibacterial properties. Mix 2 teaspoons of white vinegar and 1 teaspoon of salt in Ω cup of warm water. Rinse your mouth with this mixture once or twice a day.

oDJnLMaJjzs,DIY Weird Back To School Supplies You Need To Try!,"[MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, guys! It's Rachel. So I did a DIY weird back-to-school supplies video last year, because I want to make weird a good thing. A lot of things that are weird are cool, right? So I decided to do the same exact thing this year. Also, I'm currently having a back-to-school giveaway, where I give away a MacBook Air. And the only rule to enter is that you must be subscribed. So if you're already subscribed, then you're already automatically entered. The giveaway originally ended on August 12. But I think I'm going to change it to ending on the 28, because it's back to school, and people aren't necessarily back to school yet at that point. OK, first things first. Since we're working with hot glue and sharp objects, have a parent help you, because-- Ow! Ow! [BLADE CLICKS] [BLADE CLICKS] Yeah. [MUSIC PLAYING] Firstly, you'll need some lipsticks and some pencils. Measure up how short your pencil will need to be, and then take the lipstick out of the container. And you can just take that lipstick and put it into a small container and save it so you can actually wear it. Don't ever just waste lipstick like that. Please. Start cutting the pencil by rotating it in a pair of scissors until it just breaks. Make sure the pencil fits. Then take some air-drying clay, and stick it in a lipstick container. And stick the pencil after that, then clean up the edges. You can make so many of these with just one pencil, because they're so short. So don't just throw out the pencil once you've finished with it. Just sharpen it again, and cut it again. Then take some paint. I like to paint the tips of them to look like they're lipstick colors. But obviously, if you don't want to do this, that's fine, because when you sharpen it, it's going to erase anyways. [MUSIC PLAYING] For the s'mores notebooks, take two notebooks and glue them on top of each other. Next, take a graham-cracker-colored T-shirt, whatever that means, and fold it in half, and cut it. Then glue the edges to the first and last page of the notebook. Once you've done that, fill it up with cotton balls so it has a fluffy look to it. Then glue the last edge down. Now mark nine dots on top of the notebook. Cut some small holes into them, then glue those holes down. And color on top of the dots with the brown. I call this one the ""Campfire Song Song."" [SINGING] Let's gather 'round the campfire and sing our campfire song. At least now the teacher might take you a little bit more seriously if you're trying to pretend that your dog ate your homework. But then there's chocolate in it, so. [MUSIC PLAYING] For the eraser rings, first tape down the surface so that it doesn't get messy. Then take some silicone, which is surprisingly easier to find than you'd think-- I just got this from Target-- and some baby powder. Squeeze some silicone onto the tape, and then pour baby powder all over it. Then take some chalk, and I'll let you know what that's for in a second. But just mix up the silicone with the baby powder until it looks like this clay texture. Then take an eraser and literally erase nothing, because the more eraser shavings that you have, the better it will erase when you actually use it. Then mix that in. Take the chalk and draw on literally nothing again, because clearly I'm super into that. And then roll the clay in it to change the clay's color. Now, roll up half the clay so that it fits around your finger as the ring band. Then take some diamond silicone molds. I mean, you could shape them yourself. But I cannot shape them myself, so I'm using this. Let it sit for two hours until it's dry. Then attach them. You can always add more eraser clay to attach them. But ain't nobody feel like waiting another two hours. Like, really? So I'm going to hot-glue-gun them together. [MUSIC - BEYONCE, ""SINGLE LADIES (PUT A RING ON IT)""] I didn't have enough rings to write ""hi."" [MUSIC PLAYING] To make the little soda can sharpener, just take any small cylinder-shaped object-- I'm using a sprinkles container-- and a silver Sharpie. And draw over the entire thing. [MUSIC - ETTA JAMES, ""AT LAST""] Then take the top off, and draw a mark to where you want to cut the little circle out so you can add the sharpener in there comfortably. Then glue the sharpener in. Now search for any soda can logo online. You can use Sprite or whatever you want. Then minimize the size of it to 20%, and print it out. This printer so abusively grabs the paper. [INAUDIBLE] It completely crumbled it up. Cut out the logo. And add some packing tape on it so that it's protected, because we're all way too lazy to laminate it. Then glue the logo on around the container. And to show you that you can literally make anything into a sharpener, I cut a whole out of the bottom of this M&amp;M container and glued the sharpener in it. And I used a long pair of scissors as tweezers. And voila, sharpener. So I hope you guys enjoyed this video. If you didn't see my previous two videos, click those down below.

qYZHNNzTrl0,What's Inside My Pencil Case / Art Supplies Pouch | Art Journal Thursday Ep. 10,"(jazzy music) - [mako] Hey guys. Welcome back to another episode of Art Journal Thursday, where we get creative every single Thursday here on this channel. And because this was highly requested, I will show you what's inside my art supplies pencil case today. The first thing I have with me is a set of Faber-Castell pencils that I got not so long ago. I like the fact that they all have different grades from 8B to 2H so you can use them for different things like sketching and shading, and I also like that they are all in one box, so it's easier to carry them around as well. As you could see, my HB pen was already halfway down. That's why I carry around another HB pencil with me by Faber-Castell as well. It's like my go-to pencil when I just want to quickly draw or write something down. It has a nice grip around it, so it's really comfortable to hold it in your hand. The grip here is already almost worn off because I usually always use it. That's why it's almost gone. Next we have a kneadable eraser by Faber-Castell as well. I like using it for small details I want to erase because you can just knead it into the right shape, and it's also great to just lift up some of the pencil or charcoal without making any mess. To clean this type of eraser, you just need to knead it a few times until you don't see any lead anywhere. I also have two other erasers that I like using also by Faber-Castell. They never dried out on me like some other erasers, and it's so super-easy to erase any mistake, especially big areas. And if I need a more firm eraser that I can use for tiny details, I like using this eraser pen that is super-handy when it comes to really tiny areas you want to erase in your drawings. I also have my sharpener with me, also by Faber-Castell. No, I'm not sponsored by them. I just really enjoy using their tools. This type of sharpener is great for carrying around because it's small, but it has enough space to keep lots of pencil shavings inside that you can easily remove by pulling out the part of the sharpener. I also have a triangle ruler with me because it's so versatile, and you can use just as a ruler, but you could also always make sure that you use the right angle in case you need it. Next I have some watercolor pencils by Hahnemühle with me. Since I rarely use color pencils but still use them from time to time, I have this small set with me that is super-versatile as well, as it has the most-used colors that you can also mix together like watercolors, so you get even more colors out of them. Next we have my beloved Staedtler fineliners in different sizes. I really love them because they glide so smoothly over the paper, even over watercolor paper that has some texture. They are waterproof so I always use them whenever I want to paint with watercolors. Just make sure you always wait a little bit before you go in with watercolors. But I also have my Faster-Castell artist pens with me because I also enjoy using them especially for thicker outlines. They are also waterproof and glide smoothly over the paper, but lately I prefer the Staedtler fineliners kind of more because they work a little better on rougher paper. And I also have my Tombow brush pen with me that is great for hand-lettering in case I want to use them in my bullet journal or somewhere else. I'm still practicing hand-lettering, so I'm still not super-confident in using it, but we will get there. Next I have this Pentel brush pen that is super-versatile as well. You can use for hand-lettering, coloring, sketching. It's really like a brush. It can create thick and thin lines depending on how you hold the pen. Then I have my beloved Uni-Ball white ink pen with me that I always use. It's great because it really covers dark areas, runs smoothly over the paper, and I had never problems with it because other white pens I have tried so far are just not working for me. I also carry around two watercolor sets with me at the moment. One is by Winsor &amp; Newton and the other one is by Schmincke. The Winsor &amp; Newton set is great for beginners because you get lots of different colors and good quality for a good price, and it even has a small brush that you can use if you're on the go. But I also love using my Schmincke watercolor set that I've been using for years. I personally prefer the Schmincke set, but as you can see, I ran out of a couple of colors that I need to replace ASAP. That's why I use two sets for now. I also have a few brushes with me. At the moment I have two flat-angled brushes and four brushes in different sizes. Except one brush, they are all by the brand da Vinci because I love using their brushes. They've never lost hair, and they're just so fun and easy to use. I also have an aqua brush in case I want to play around with hand-lettering again, or just want to use it for watercoloring. Something else I always have with me is my notebook by Clairefontaine. I don't always have it in my bag but always with me anyway. I've used up so many of these notebooks. They have great, smooth paper, and I especially like this ring-bind version because you can just flip and turn around the pages so easily, and focus on one page at a time. Last but not least, I also carry around a blue ball pen with me to write down ideas and notes, and this type is one of the cheapest but so comfortable to use. I somehow find that the cheapest ball pens are the best in the end. I don't know. Is it just me? And these were all my go-to supplies I always use and take with me whenever I travel somewhere else but still want to paint or draw something. It looks heavier than it actually is. It's super-light but has everything I need inside. And if you want to know more about my favorite art supplies in more detail, you can check out my video right here.

5iFQpVJm-jM,DIY Miniature- IKEA Coffee Tables Tutorial,"Hi guys! It’s Cath and today I have a super easy miniature tutorial for you. We’re going to make some mini IKEA coffee tables. These are from the ikea LACK series and I absolutely love the simplicity in its design. Let’s get started with the smaller square table first. I grab a quarter inch thick piece of wood. This is simple craft plywood that you can get almost anywhere. Draw a 2 inch by 2 inch square and cut that out. For me, the easiest way to break this plywood is to score it with your craft knife on both sides and then use some force to snap it. See? Easy. Sand down all the sides for a smooth finish. Then grab some quarter inch thick square dowels. You want the thickness of the dowels to be the same as the thickness of the tabletop This will create a more uniform look. Using a miter saw, I cut 4 1.5 inch pieces for the legs. Then sand it so the ends are flat. To make sure all the 4 legs are the exactly same length, I rubberband them together and sand them all at one time. Add some wood glue to each corner of the tabletop and carefully position each leg on a corner. So simple! You could make these with your eyes closed. For our second coffee table, we use the same quarter inch thick craft plywood and cut out a 2.5 by 4 inch rectangle. Because this is plywood, there is a chance of getting some dents and holes when you cut it. To fix this, I just add some wood glue on those parts and smooth it out with my knife. When this dries, it’ll be perfectly smooth. I grab the square dowel again and cut out 4 1.5 inch pieces for legs. This coffee table and the smaller one are exactly the same height. Just as we did before, glue them on to each corner. Then I get a thin piece of plywood for the shelf of this table. This piece is pretty thin. About 1/8 of an inch thick. Cut out a 2 inch by 4 inch rectangle. Look at out nicely that snaps out. Add some wood glue to the inner side of each table leg. I add it about halfway up the leg, but the height is completely up to you. This piece will fit perfectly between the table legs. I love how this looks. So simple and modern. And so easy to make! The IKEA lack series comes in bare wood color, but I really want these to be white so I get some titanium white acrylic paint and cover both these pieces. 2 coats of paint should be more than enough. Now this part is optional but I’m going to add some varnish to make these tables nice and shiny. I added about 3 coats of polyacrylic to get this really glossy finish. See the difference? The underside here is unvarnished and the top is. I just love the glossy look. That’s it guys! I hope you liked this video!

V8RO9OaLGWo,Make a Corkboard World Map,"Hello and welcome back to Switch and Lever! I'm not even going to make any excuses for this video, I love maps, and my walls have been too long without one. But what fun is a map if you can't mark where did you come from, where did you go, where did you come from, Cotton Eye Joe? So follow along as we make a corkboard map, so you can pin all your favourite places. But wait a minute, I hear you say, cork is so expensive!? Indeed it is, if you want to buy cork on a roll, especially for a bigger map like we're making, it's going to set you back a little. Let's go to IKEA and think it over, maybe there's a solution to this issue among the lingondricka and meatballs in the restaurant? Of course! We can buy some IKEA cork placemats. They're just a few bucks for a pack of four. While they're a bit thin for a corkboard, you can always double them up for a thicker board. Now, to find a way out of this home decoration maze... Unfortunately the cork isn't ideal for a bigger board right out of the package. First thing we need to do is to cut off the rounded corners, so there are no gaps between the cork pieces when we patch them together. Since cork is a somewhat floppy material we next need to attach them to something more sturdy. Use a piece of thin plywood, or masonite, and sprayglue the the cork pieces down to stick. Don't do the same mistake as me and try to glue to the non-smooth side of the masonite, it will just absorb the glue and nothing will stick. Flip it over and restart! Once you've done the first layer, add another layer, but overlap the seams so there is nowhere one could stick a pin between a full two layers of cork. Again, since the cork is quite floppy you may want to weigh down what you glue as you're working. Finally you're going to have to weigh it down with something large and flat to distribute pressure all over the cork, and leave it until the glue cures. When the weights come off you may have found that some parts have shifted slightly, and for some reason expanded, so curse to yourself a bit while you break out your carpet knife and start trimming the edges to match the size of the underlying board. To make sure nothing will separate over time, or if the glue should fail that nothing will lift, tape all the seams with wide clear packaging tape to hold it down. Also, if you tape the fuzzy backside of the masonite with duct tape you can fold over the edges of the clear tape and it will actually stick. The reason for using clear tape, as opposed to duct tape, on the front is in case the paper map which will be applied is slightly translucent. This way the cork will be even all over, and no taped seams can be seen through the map. Now we're getting to the most exicing part since the meatballs, choosing your map. There are many maps out there, and you can sure just buy a map to fit your board, but there are also other ways to obtain a map which will suit just you. The best location you can find maps online is no doubt the David Rumsey Map Collection. It allows you to browse more than 30000 maps from all over the world, and through many ages of time. It also allows download of most of the maps in very high resolutions, which is suitable for poster printing, even at the demanding quality required for maps. Pause this video, have a browse, realize you spent the entire night looking at maps, come back to this video and finish it before going to bed. It's worth it, trust me! With your map in hand we can move on. You may want to protect the actual surface of your map a bit more using sticky back plastic. Since I don't particularly like the look of shiny maps I chose to cover the map in matte plastic. You can get this kind of plastic from most stationery or craft stores. It can be a bit tricky to apply, especially to something this big. The best way I found is to remove the backing from one edge of the plastic and attach just that edge of your poster. Then slowly work yourself down the poster, slowly removing the backing from the rest of the plastic, while pushing from the center out to push out as many air bubbles as possible. Once the poster is all stuck down to the plastic you can bring back your corkboard and match it up with your map. Fold up the edges of the sticky back plastic to the back of the board to attach the poster securely. Some bubbles are unfortunately unavoidable, but they're not the end of the world. Since paper isn't entirely airtight most bubbles can simply be gently pushed out. The more persistant bubbles may require puncturing to give a small hole for the air to escape from. This puncture mark won't be visible once the bubble is squeezed out though. Almost done now! Of course you could stop here and just hang your corkboard, but wouldn't it look much nicer in a frame? Yes, yes it would. I simply taped the board onto the frame with framing tape. It's definitely enough to hold it in place, but if you're worried you could always add a few small nails as well. To hang it, just run a thin wire from each side of the frame and attach it securely. Here we're using a staple gun, but you could just as well use nails instead. Just be careful not to damage the frame. All that's left now is to hang it up and start pinning all those places you've been, or plan to go, or whatever else your imagination can think of.

hst2RSV6nrE,Miniature Dorm Desk Tutorial,"Hi guys! It’s Cath. Today we’re going to make a miniature college dorm desk. This desk looks exactly like the one I used in college so it was a ton of fun making it. As usual, this is in 1:12 scale standard dollhouse size. Let’s get started. The first thing I do is grab a sheet of craft plywood. This sheet is 1/8 inch thick so it’s pretty easy to cut. Draw a 2.5 by 3.25 inch rectangle. This will be the back of your desk. Cut it out by running your X-acto knife on both sides and snapping the wood off. All you need is a little force. Or a lot. Then I draw out three 2.5 by 2 inch rectangles. Cut those out. Breaking this wood is so satisfying. Okay let’s assemble these pieces. Lay the first rectangle flat on your table. Add wood glue to the long side of the each smaller rectangle and position them in place. One on each end... and one in between them. The middle piece should be 1.25 inches away from the right side. Then cut out a 1.25 by 1.8 inch rectangle. This will be the bottom of the drawer area. Add glue and slide that into place. Now cut out two 3.5 by 2 inch rectangles. One will be the top of the desk and one will be the back of the bookshelf. Let’s put the top of the desk on first. Add wood glue... Put it on. Super easy. Then take that second rectangle, add glue to the long side and position it vertically at the back edge of the desk. Next, let’s grab a jumbo position stick. Draw out two 2 inch sections. Cut those out. These will form the sides of the bookshelf. Add glue and position them in place. Then cut out two 3.25 inch sections from more popsicle sticks. These will be the shelves for the bookshelf. Place one ¾ of an inch from the top of the desk and the other one ¼ of an inch from the top. Once that’s dry, grab some wooden coffee stirrers. You actually only need one. Cut out a 3.25 inch section and glue it to the front of the bottom shelf. This creates a ledge. Just a nice detail. Let’s build the drawers next. I first cut out three 1.25 by 1.75 inch rectangles for the drawer bottoms. This means we’ll have three drawers in this section (2 small ones and 1 big one). Let’s build the sides for the two smaller drawers first. Grab some more wooden coffee stirrers. These are ¼ inch in width. To make them thicker, I like to add wood glue and stack 2 together. Use some binder clips to hold them in place until the glue dries. Mark the lengths you need by positioning it against the drawer bottom. Then use a miter saw to cut them out. For reference, it’s two 1.75 inch pieces and one 1 inch piece. Add wood glue and position those pieces on top of the drawer bottom. Make 2 of these. For the third and biggest drawer, I cut out two 1.75 inch sections and one 1 inch section. This is just using more jumbo popsicle sticks. Glue those to the 3 sides of the last drawer bottom. Before we can slide these into the desk, we need to create some ledges for them to sit on. For that, I use some craft matchsticks. Cut out four 1.5 inch pieces and glue them to the inside walls of the drawer area. The first set should be ½ inch away from the top and the other set 1/2 inch away from the first set. Now slide those drawers in. They fit perfectly. Let’s add them drawer fronts to finish these off. I grab another jumbo popsicle stick and cut out four 1.25 inch sections. Take two of those and glue them together. This will be the front for the biggest drawer. For the other two pieces, draw a line at the ½ inch mark and cut off the excess. These will be the fronts for the 2 smaller drawers. Now all you need to do is add glue to and position the drawer fronts into place. Adding them on now when the drawers are already inside the desk will ensure you get a seamless look. Almost there guys. One last drawer to make. Cut out a 1.75 inch square from that same craft plywood. Do the same method as before with more coffee stirrers for the sides. Glue those on. For the drawer front, I cut out a 1.75 inch piece from a standard popsicle stick. Glue it to the drawer front and you’re done. Just add matchsticks again for the ledge and slide the drawer into place. This desk is looking great as is but I really wanted it to look authentic so I’m going to add some color to this wood. I mix some dark brown acrylic paint with some water and then add a small droplet of yellow. This will create a really muddy yellowish stain. Add the stain in layers so you can control how dark the wood gets. You can do this to the insides of the drawers too but I didn't bother with that. I did about 2-3 coats in total to get this color. Then finally, for a glossy look, I’m going to brush on some polyacrylic. I did 2 layers of this stuff. Look at that nice sheen the poly gives it. And that’s it guys! The miniature dorm desk is all complete! Just add a bunch of trinkets to make the it look super messy and your desk will look like any real dorm desk. If you like the miniature laptop, folder, post-it notes and bulletin board that I have on this desk, I’ll show you how to make that in my next video! I already have videos of all the other trinkets so make sure to check those out. I hope you guys like this video. Give it a thumbs up if you did and make sure to subscribe for more!

7ADWYKl7OD4,Concrete Planter | easy DIY,"What's that? Ah, it's my concrete planter! Hello, how are you doing? Welcome to my YouTube Channel, I'm Julian and this is 1989go. Today I'm making a very easy concrete planter and I'm basically using just these two plastic containers the plants come with. First I'm just taping the outside of the bigger container and then tape the inside of the smaller Container. I make sure every hole is covered very well and the only thing important here is that there is no way for liquids to come through. Now I'm taking this piece of a branch and surround it with tape as well. Then i'm using some hot glue to glue the branch to the bottom of the big container and this is how they should look like after preparation. Then I'm doing the same like in my previous videos just adding some household oil to the form. It's time to mix the concrete now and I'm making sure I'm adding the right amount of water. I'm placing the small container in the middle of the big container and I use some stones to have some extra weight. Vibrating the mold will remove the air bubbles. I added some tape and then let the concrete cure.. How long you need to wait depends on the concrete mix and it's normally written on the packaging. I remove the mold and then also the little branch Piece. Then I waited some more time and finally sealed the inside. I used a white color that's compatible with stone but there are also special concrete sealer for this purpuse. For me painting is very relaxing and I really liked that step. I finally glued some little feet on the bottom. While you are you seeing me planting this little cutie I want to ask you did you like it, didn't you like it? Please let me know in the comments what do you think about the video and my project. Okay let's clean this mess up and see the final result.

N9BuzdDdUlA,Miniature Modern IKEA Desk Tutorial,"Hi guys! It’s Cath and today I have another IKEA inspired miniature tutorial for you. We’re going to make this really modern and clean looking Micke desk. This is a really fun project that only requires just a few simple supplies. Let’s get started. The main material I’m using for this project is craft plywood. This is an eight of an inch thick and easy to cut with just my craft knife. Draw a 4.5 inch by 1.75 inch rectangle and cut that out. The easiest way to break this plywood is to cut it with your craft knife on both sides and use some force to snap it. This piece will be the top of the desk. Use the same technique to cut out a 2.5 by 1.75 rectangle, a small 1 by 1.75inch rectangle, 1.5 by 4.25 inch rectangle and lastly, a 1 by 4.25 inch thin rectangle for the back of the desk. I take the top of the desk and add a line of glue to each of the shorter sides. Position the 2.5 by 1.75 rectangle to one side. And then add the small 1inch by 1.75 inch rectangle to the other side. As you can see, the bigger rectangle acts as the desk legs on one side. The shorter side will be a little more interesting. But first, let’s finish assembling the rest of these pieces. Take the thin 1 by 4.25 inch piece and add glue to the edges of 3 sides. Position it under the top of the desk between the 2 pieces we just glued on. Then just grab that last 1.5 by 4.25 piece and slide it into place half an inch under the top of the desk. This creates the compartment where we will slide in the drawers. But first, let’s finish the legs. I’ll be using some craft matchsticks because they’re like super tiny square dowels. Cut out two 1.6 inch pieces and one 1.5 inch piece. Flip the desk over and add a drop of glue to each corner of the shorter side. Add a 1.6 inch piece to each side. Then grab that last piece of matchstick and glue it between the bottoms of the matchstick legs. Crazy how that one piece makes the whole desk look modern. Okay, now I need to add a divider in this drawer section because we’ll be putting in 2 drawers. I cut out a 1.75 by 0.5 inch strip and slide it into the middle of that compartment. Now we can make the actual drawers. Cut out two 2 inch by 1.5 inch rectangles. These will be the bottoms of the drawers. Make sure they fit into the compartments snugly. For the drawer sides, I grab a bunch of coffee stirrers. These are a quarter of an inch thick. To add some strength, I double them up. Just add wood glue between 2 strips and clamp them down until it dries. Once they’re dry, line them up against the drawer bottom and mark the lengths you need. Do this for 3 sides. Cut them out. For reference, it’s one 2 inch piece and two 1.5 inch pieces. Glue them onto the drawer bottom with some wood glue. We’re just adding them to the sides and back so the front will be open for now. If there’s any unevenness, sand it down, You want it to be flush so the drawer front goes on nicely. Do that to the other drawer bottom too. Here I’m sliding these pieces into the drawer compartment. They fit perfectly. For the drawer fronts, I cut out a 0.6 inch thick strip of wood. Line it up against the desk and mark the lengths you need. Cut them out. For reference, these are 2 inches long. Add some glue to the drawer and position the drawer front onto it. Once the glue dries, you can pull the drawer out and look- it’s finished! Doing it this way inside the desk ensures that everything looks flush. Alright, let’s paint this bad boy. I’m using titanium white acrylic paint. Obviously, you can choose any color you like. About 2 coats should do the trick. I add paint basically everywhere including the insides of the drawers. Then add on a few coats of polyacrylic varnish for a glossy look. I add gloss everywhere except on the inside of the drawer compartment and on the outside of the drawers. That’s just to make sure the drawers don’t get stuck inside the desk. That’s it guys! The Micke desk is all done. Super clean look that’s perfect for any modern dollhouse. I have another video coming up showing you how to make some desk accessories so be on the lookout for that!

jsDfE809ptI,HOW TO ORGANIZE YOUR HOME OFFICE !!!,"Hey what's up guys! Welcome to another episode of Pan The Organizer, where you and I work together to help you organize different aspects of your life! In today's show, I'm going to show you how to organize your office! Now the office is a space you often use for work, so it's very important to keep everything nice and tidy to increase your efficiency and to have a bit more fun while you're doing that work! So come with me, let me show you how I organize my desk. By the way, all the items that we'll discuss in this show will be linked in the description down below to make it easy for you guys if you want to purchase anything. So come with me and let's check it out! So to start off, in my office, in the drawers, I used some storage trays under which I put a bit of putty so they stay fixed and you can open and close the drawer without them sliding around and that's how I neatly organize into different categories my things. For example, some Apple chargers and USB wires, different batteries and battery chargers, some LED lights with recharging wires, and different stuff. So this way, everything stays neatly organized and I can access everything rapidly. Now the next drawer, again, same principle, are these little storage compartments into which I keep my things neatly organized. Now here's where the magic lays. Now, there are some tapes for this little bad boy. Now this is a Brother P-Touch label maker. And you'll see how that comes into play later on in my other organizing series. But very important tool. Now in the bottom drawer, this is where I keep my different files. These are all colour coded and this is where I used the P-Touch label maker to neatly label everything. So they're easily accessible. So I can remove one of the folders, and access what's inside and put it back where it belongs. So everything's neatly organized, colour coded. Now in this unit, you'll see that I placed my paper shredder and a wireless printer in the bottom. Same thing in this drawer. This is where I keep my other tray with organized goods, this is for a white board. Here I keep anything headset related, so some headphones when I do my video editing. And in the lower one, paper for the printer. So here, we have some shelving units for which I use to store the things that I use for shooting my YouTube videos. So I store my lenses here, my USB microphone, some tripods and audio equipment. So this is neatly organized as well. Now this is my girlfriend's desk and this is how she organizes her space. Now a little shelf with some bookends to keep the books neatly organized. Now here she has storage compartments for all the papers and bills that she uses to keep things neatly organized. So she can just pulls those out. And again, in the drawers she also keeps some nice trays to keep everything organized. Now on the wall, you can use one of these cork boards to organize paperwork: it could be some appointments that you might have in the coming week at the doctor, your work schedule, anything that you might need. Also you can use this as your dream board. So what ever you want for the next year, you can mentally visualize it, you can print out a picture and put it on there. So that's it guys. You saw how easy it was to organize your office into a neat, tidy space, where you'll increase your efficiency at work and hopefully have some fun at doing it as well! I hope you enjoyed this show. If so, please leave some thumbs up down below. SUBSCRIBE to my YouTube channel! And follow me on social media. In the meantime, don't forget to keep it tight, keep it clean and I'll see you guys on the next one!!!",Hobbies and Crafts,Woodworking,Make a Bulletin Board from a Drawer,True,3633,en,en
4G8vDgr6c9A,How To Make Steampunk Brass Goggles From Foam DIY Pattern Tutorial,"Hi, My name is Chris and I like to make things. Hey guys, today we're gonna make some goggles, steampunk style. Okay, cut your pattern. Trace it out nice and pretty. Carefully cut the foam. Being sure to leave enough space for: a moustache Glue the two ends of pattern piece A1 together with contact adhesive. Apply a thin layer of contact adhesive to the back of piece A2, and to the outside of piece A1. Now line em up and stick 'em together. Now remember, when using contact adhesive, the way it's done is you spread it out first, let it dry till it's tacky and then put the pieces together. That's what I'll be doing throughout this whole thing, so I'm not going to say it again. Okay. Now I found a bottle that's just the right size to keep the eyecup nice and round to glue it. Check that the front rim's going to fit. Yep. And cut it and glue it. Then do the same thing for the other eye. Grab a hole punch and go crazy. Oh yeah, crazy hole punching. Glue on the little circles, and cut some notches so they look like little screw heads. Nose piece N2. Glue it. But only up to the line on either side. Apply glue to the eyecup, put it all together and you've got something that's looking a bit like goggles. Apply glue to the top and a little bit on each of the eyecups as well as on piece N1. And stick it all together. glue the straps on the sides. Now I'm going to make some rivets with two part epoxy and a match which you can see in detail in ""How To Make A Steampunk Tophat"" O.K., pattern piece C2 gets cut out of some sort of thin plastic. Bend the little tab thing up.Push it through the foam at one end of the strap. Now glue that piece in place on the inside of the band, it's going to get sandwiched between the band and pattern piece C1 to hold it in place.Like this. Now fold the other part of C1 around the band and glue it just on the bottom leaving enough space for the strap to go through the little hole. Poke a bunch of holes on the other side of the band with a pen or something sharp. If you have a leather punch, now would be the time to use it. Finish them off by wrapping some yarn around the nose piece. These are your basic orange foam goggles. Like everyone has. You can do them up, put em on your head, if you want, which I do. Now, the thing is, how are you going to make them different? Maybe by adding some fancy accoutrement on the side. I want it to look like there are little pipes running around the sides of the glasses,which I am going to make from plastic line trimmer wire.You know the stuff that spins around really fast and shreds your weeds in your yard? That's the stuff. If you heat it up a bit you can bend it quite easily and make it fit your goggles. Okay, this part is optional, but it's really fun and it adds a lot of strength and resilience to the centre nose part of your goggles. I've got some liquid latex here and I'm mixing in some black acrylic paint.The great thing about this is that the rubber will soak into the nose piece and hold it's shape once it's dry.you'll want to do a couple of coats of rubber. Once it's dry, you can add your metallic acrylic paint. Apply it sparingly to the raised surfaces with a fingertip. now it's time for the lenses.if you're lucky like me, they'll just fit. Perfectly. If you're not lucky,you're gonna have to cut them, which, I would recommend a jewellers saw, a coping saw, or a jigsaw.Something like that. Or make them out of thin enough plastic you can cut them with scissors. Well, that's it. Thanks for watching. If you would like a copy of the goggles pattern, just click on the link in this video. Cheers, bye bye. Do you wanna see me try them on? I haven't even seen them on me, so we'll see.I have never had a pair of orange goggles before. How do I look? Am I even in focus? I can't tell cause I'm not wearing my glasses. Sweet",Hobbies and Crafts,Crafts,Make Steampunk Goggles,True,3840,en,en

First up, let's make a grocery bag container. Stuff a plastic bag inside an empty and open baby wipe container. Take another empty plastic bag and loop it through the handles of the first bag, and then stuff the bottom of the second bag and the handles of the first bag into the container. Just leave the handles of the second bag out so you can repeat the process and stuff in as many bags as you can fit. When you're ready for a bag, all you do is lightly tug on the handle. The next bag will pop out and be ready for action. Now, if you don't have any empty baby wipe containers, perhaps you have an empty tissue box or a cereal box or even cardboard soda case instead. Now that first main hole that dispenses soda cans is great for both loading your plastic grocery bags and removing them. These up-cycled containers of bags can be stored in any room with a small trash can for easy re-bagging. They're also perfect to keep in your car for road trips. No matter how you reuse bags, you can pack more into the dispenser or box, and they look much better organized in the container than stuffed in an overflowing drawer. Maybe you're one of the many people in the world that gets car sick. Or you're just picking up your buddy that had a bit too much to drink. Either way, having an improvised car sick bag can save you from a disaster. Get a small brown bag to conceal any contents, and a plastic bag to catch any nefarious waste. Place the plastic inside and simply fold the paper over and roll that plastic right under it to secure it in place. Now just snap it into the back or front seat and drive your ride with confidence. Now if you don't have help unloading or loading your groceries or if you're just one of those people who refuses to make more than one trip from the car, we have a great solution. Before you go grocery shopping, put a laundry basket in your trunk. It'll make it easy to bring in all your stuff in one pain-free trip. Also keep in mind, if you want to avoid collecting even more plastic bags, just throw some reusable bags in your basket as well. Ice cream is full of fat. Even when frozen, fat has a way of absorbing flavors from the air around it. This includes those in your freezer. To keep your ice cream from taking on the odor of that fish or last week's chili, wrap a plastic bag between your ice cream and the lid. Now tie it off at the bottom. The plastic prevents the surface of the ice cream from drying out and crystallizing once opened, so it never gets that leathery layer on top. Science! To avoid having your groceries shift around your vehicle on your ride home, causing a mess, feed a bungee cord through the handles of each bag and keep them in their full and upright locked position. It only takes a few seconds, and you'll prevent junk in the trunk. Sometimes it's hard to get rid of all those old socks, leaving you with an overabundance of 'em. But you can just hang a grocery bag from a hangar with strap slots. Now just stuff as many socks, belts, ties, or whatever you want, and never struggle with drawer space again. Hey, it's not pretty, but we all have skeletons in our closet. Do you want to see a magic trick? Or how about a little craft tacking? Check this old one out. You can swap an item from side to side with minimal effort using just a paper bag and some tape. It's known as the magic wallet. Pull off the handles of the bag. Most grocery stores have these now, and if they don't, just cut out more paper to make up for it. Slice a couple four by seven inch sheets from a bag or 10 by 17 centimeters if you're on the more enlightened system. If you want to get extra crafty, slice 'em bigger. It's your choice, but these measurements work. Wrap them in beautiful mustache duct tape or any duct tape for that matter. That'll make it last and also a bit more fashionable. But most importantly, more durable. Take the straps and cut them to be about an inch longer on each side of the cards. Again, that's 2.45 centimeters for the rest of the world. Tuck both ends around the back and tape 'em down. Then run them to the other card and tape them on the back as well. Okay, now we're gettin' somewhere. When that's done, cut two more strips from the handles and tape 'em on the back. Flip it and run 'em between the two so you can tape on the back of the first card. Think of it like a weave. Now it's done. Place something, anything. I chose an old iPhone 5. Put it in there and fold it over. Boom! It shifts to the other side completely. This is nothing short of literal magic. Or just being hacky craft. How fun! But let's move on to bugs. If yellow jackets or wasps are invading your space, there's a great way to get rid of them without harming them. Now, we covered this a couple of years ago, but it bears repeating. Take a brown paper bag and flip it inside-out so the print isn't showing. In most cases this'll be enough, but you can go ahead and stuff it with some extra baggage to make sure that it doesn't lose its shape. You see, a crumpled paper bag looks a lot like a nest, and these critters don't like to have any territorial battles. Once flipped, tie it off at the top and take it outside and hang it away from where you hang out. The bugs will see it and move on, keeping you pest free without an unnecessary extermination. Now here's the thing. If you're just overflowing with grocery bags, go ahead and return them to the grocery store or put 'em in your paper recycling bin. Natural resources are used to make those bags, so the more returned, the better. Obviously, you want to keep what you think you'll need, but keep in mind there's more where they came from. All right, see you next time, friends. (light, playful music)",Hobbies and Crafts,Crafts,Clean Reusable Shopping Bags,True,5986,en,en
W6WaZMiV1yI,Creamy Tuscan Garlic Chicken ~ One Pot Chicken Dinner Recipe,"This is a creamy, yummy and comforting meal and easy on the budget. I'm Tess and I'm going to show you how to make this delicious, creamy Tuscan garlic chicken from start to finish. I have three large boneless chicken breasts i simply cut in half. So, I have three thick pieces and three thinner ends. You can use any chicken cut or piece, bone in or bone out for this recipe. These boneless chicken breasts just happened to be on sale at our local grocery store. In my pan on medium heat, I'm adding some avocado oil and you can use the cooking oil of your choice. I'm adding my chicken pieces and seasoning each side with a little bit of salt and black pepper. I'm browning each side for about two to three minutes and then I'm removing the chicken from the pan and setting to the side. You can find this recipe and the list of ingredients in the description box below. In the same pan on medium heat, I'm adding some sliced onions, mushrooms and a little bit of salt and black pepper. Giving that a good stir and as the onions and mushrooms cook they will pick up all those flavorful tidbits on the bottom. Next, I'm adding some sliced fresh garlic... and lots of it! Stirring and cooking for another minute to get that garlic-infused. This is optional but I'm adding some red pepper flakes for a little kick. In goes some diced fresh plum tomatoes and some sun-dried tomatoes. These are both going to add some great flavor and color. Giving that a good mix and cooking for another 2 to 3 minutes. Now I'm adding in some Italian seasonings and giving it a stir. For the delicious creamy sauce I'm adding some cream and chicken broth. I'm turning my heat up to a medium medium-high stirring and bringing the mixture up to a simmer. If you like this creamy Tuscan garlic chicken recipe please remember to LIKE... SUBSCRIBE and leave a COMMENT below. You can also follow me on Facebook for more of what I'm cooking in my kitchen. Please feel free to share this with your friends and family. This is a bunch of fresh baby spinach. Seems like a lot but it will cook down. The spinach will add some great flavor, some texture and a beautiful color to this dish. Giving that a good mix to get the spinach incorporated. Next, I'm adding some grated Parmesan cheese... oh yeah! Another good stir and bringing up to a simmer. It is smelling so good! I'm adding the chicken and all the juices back into the pan, covering and cooking on a simmer for 10 minutes and then I'm going to give the chicken a flip, partially cover and cook for another 5 to 10 minutes. I am aware I have thicker and thinner pieces of chicken so I'm removing the thinner pieces of the chicken first letting the thicker pieces cook for another couple minutes. If you're cooking with bone-in chicken it may take a little longer. You want the internal temp of the chicken to be a hundred sixty-five degrees to be safe. Once the chicken is done, I'm removing the chicken from the pan and letting it rest. For the sauce I'm tasting for last-minute seasonings. Bringing the sauce back up to a simmer and adding just a little slurry to thicken the sauce. Not much. I want the sauce to be gravy thickness. For more flavor I have some additional Parmesan cheese and for burst of flavor, I have some fresh basil leaves! Giving that a good stir, cooking for another minute and we are ready to eat! Serving tonight with some linguine and I have a side salad of garden lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers and green onions... and of course we have to have some garlic bread! A great budget meal that is delicious... quick, easy and comforting. Nice and creamy with lots of flavor! I just love all the garlic, spinach and the sun-dried tomatoes. I hope you give this creamy Tuscan garlic chicken recipe a try. Until next time, enjoy. And Thanks so much for joining me here in my kitchen.

gH2Uok-9Y8A,iPhone 7 Plus Screen Replacement done in 6 minutes,"It's time to replace the screen on an iPhone 7 Plus. This is actually my personal phone. The only phone I have ever broken...... on accident. Everything still works great, its just the screen is shattered to bits. I went to hug a friend and her purse knocked it out of my hand... and it was ""Merry Christmas"" to the ground. The broken LCD perfectly blocks out my battery life indicator, the time of day, and and the name of the person I am texting. So it is definitely time to fix this thing. [Intro] Its pretty much the exact same process as the regular iPhone 7. There are two pentalobe screws down at the bottom of the phone right next to where the headphone jack used to be. If you need a screwdriver or a replacement screen Ill link those for you in the video description right below this video. Now, heat is not 100% mandatory for this repair, but it does help soften the thin band of adhesive that surrounds the screen on all sides. This is a type of waterproofing adhesive. So after completing this repair, your phone will not be water resistant any more. But.. if you screen is cracked, its already not water resistant. So you aren't losing too much. Im taking one of my thin metal pry tools, and going between the metal frame of the phone, and the plastic edge of the screen and cutting through the adhesive. This makes lifting off the screen a lot easier. Dont slide very deep though, because there are ribbon cables along the right side of the screen that are very important. The bottom of the screen will lift up, and then you have to pull the top of the screen down and out of the phone frame, before the whole thing flips open like a book. For this next part we need a new bit, its called a y000 tri point screw driver. And Ill include a link for that in the video description. There are 7 of these tripoint screws holding down 2 of the silver plates. It is excruciatingly important that you keep your screws organized. Put them on a separate piece of paper next to you, and draw a picture or label where each screw comes from. Some of them are different sizes. Ill use a plastic pry tool to unsnap the battery connection. So that there is no power to the rest of the device. And then Ill start uncliping the little ribbon cables. These are just like little mega blocks. Once the display and fingerprint scanner ribbons are disconnected you can unsnap the top earpiece ribbon. And that will release the screen from the body of the phone. Here is what the replacement screens look like. Remember Ill have these linked down in the video description. It is super important to be gentle to the ribbon cables. If they get bent or kinked too far in any direction, your new screen will not work after the installation is complete. We do have to transfer over some of the components to the new screen, like the ear piece and the home button. Ill start with the earpiece. There are 5 screws up here at the top that need to be removed. These ones are a regular Philips head screws. Now that the screws are out, Ill remove the top metal bracket and then slip out the little ear piece speaker, Then comes a tricky part. This little ribbon cable might look complicated, but its actually not. It is fragile though. And while it is very inexpensive to replace... its better to just keep the original intact and not rip anything, so be very gentle with it. It's about as strong as paper is. And each little segment, like the front camera, the proximity sensors, and the little golden circular contact points have some adhesive holding it to the back of the screen. Ill show you how to oragami it back into place in a second. But first lets get this home button transferred. There are 4 screws that we have down here. These are the same Y000 screws we were working with before. And once those are out, we can remove the metal bracket. This exposes the guts of the fingerprint scanner touch pad. There is one more super tiny ribbon connector. Remember that this ribbon is also very fragile, so be very careful with it, since the original home button does need to be transferred over to your new screen. Once the ribbon cable is lifted up the button will just fall out front the front side of the phone. There is only one more thing we have to remove from the old screen and that is the large metal backplate. This also has the Y000 screw on it. 3 on one side, two screws on the other side, and one more little screw down at the bottom. There is some adhesive holding the plate to the ribbon cables, you can lift that up, and then slide the whole plate up and away from the back of your old shattered screen. Take that same plate and feed the ribbons from your new working display through the little hole. Make sure to be gentle with the ribbons, and make sure they are straight, and not kinked before you screw the plate down. Get all the metal frame screws in place. 3 on the right, one at the bottom and the two on the left side. Then the home button gets put back to place from the front side of the screen.There is a little plastic guiding pin on the back of the screen that will help get the little ribbon fall in the exact place that it needs to go. Then it can be snapped into the other little connector right next to it. When you are screwing the screw for the back of the home button, make sure it is snug, but dont go too tight. Its a pretty fragile little piece of tech and a super aggressive screw might cause damage. Now lets get the front camera and ear piece into place. Remember those little plastic pins I was talking about? Those are going to be your friend up here as well. Get the ribbon down, by lining those up, and getting the little box sensor into place. It'll be like giving a cat a bath, but eventually everything should line up. The speaker gets tucked under the front camera, making sure the gold springs line up on the gold contact circles. And after the camera is tucked into the clear plastic circle, the metal plate can holds it all together. And finally we can attach the screen to the phone body again. I start with the two ribbons in the center , then clip the top ribbon down right afterward. You'll feel each of them snap into place, just like a little lego. (That has a much better ring to it), The last thing you want to plug in is the battery connector. Before putting on the metal plates, I usually test my screen to make sure everything works. If the screen is grey, or has lines running through it, it might just be a bad connection. So turn the phone off, and reconnect the little ribbon cables again. If that doesn't work, one of the ribbons might have gotten bent during the installation. Or it could just be a bad screen. Get the 7 screws back in over the metal plates, and then make sure to get the top of the screen lined up with the phone body first, before clamping the rest of the screen. Also, dont put any stress on those right side ribbon cables. Remember they are as fragile as paper. And very very important to the functionality of your phone. So don't let them rip. Thumbs up for success. I have a working phone again. I'm normally an android guy. But ive been using an iPhone for the past few months. Ill have my review video posted with my verdict very very soon. Let me know if you have any questions! I try to be pretty active down in the comments. And if I dont respond, someone else sure will. You can usually get an answer pretty quick here on my channel. My twitter followers heard the story of my broken phone the night it happened, so if you wanna stay up to date on random stuff like that head on over to my twitter. And if you've made it this far in the video... comment your favorite flavor of ice cream... Im always curious as to who makes it to the end of my videos... I personally prefer Oreo Ice cream. The more Oreos the better. Thanks a ton for watching! Ill see you around.",Hobbies and Crafts,Crafts,Prevent Electrical Accidents with Hand Tools,True,7849,en,en
